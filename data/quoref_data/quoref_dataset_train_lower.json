The power vacuum resulting from the absence of a ruling monarch as the ultimate arbiter in political disputes led to regional civil wars between local factions. Having inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, Pedro II, once he was declared of age, managed to bring peace and stability to the country, which eventually became an emerging international power. Brazil was victorious in three international conflicts (the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under Pedro II's rule, and the Empire prevailed in several other international disputes and outbreaks of domestic strife. With prosperity and economic development came an influx of European immigration, including Protestants and Jews, although Brazil remained mostly Catholic. Slavery, which had initially been widespread, was restricted by successive legislation until its final abolition in 1888. Brazilian visual arts, literature and theater developed during this time of progress. Although heavily influenced by European styles that ranged from Neoclassicism to Romanticism, each concept was adapted to create a culture that was uniquely Brazilian.\nEven though the last four decades of Pedro II's reign were marked by continuous internal peace and economic prosperity, he had no desire to see the monarchy survive beyond his lifetime and made no effort to maintain support for the institution. The next in line to the throne was his daughter Isabel, but neither Pedro II nor the ruling classes considered a female monarch acceptable. Lacking any viable heir, the Empire's political leaders saw no reason to defend the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'\u00e9tat led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the First Brazilian Republic.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Brazil", "title": "Empire of Brazil", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the person who was not seen as a viable heir to the monarchy?", "query_id": "1bf6e4ec9d939201c3b7dcac1a98f41b02e74478", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Isabel"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Isabel", "answer_start": 1558}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the government that was formed after the coup of the man who had no desire to see the monarchy survive?", "query_id": "af967652bd3271db7d04c2d9924d3ffebaef0743", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["First Brazilian Republic"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "First Brazilian Republic", "answer_start": 1951}]}]}, "4e9dc484957d25b9b7413f3b35f2921f9c932e10": {"passage": "Sir Richard Starkey  (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \"With a Little Help from My Friends\", \"Yellow Submarine\", \"Good Night\", and their cover of \"Act Naturally\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \"What Goes On\" and \"Flying\".\nStarr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best.\nStarr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \"It Don't Come Easy\", and number ones \"Photograph\" and \"You're Sixteen\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \"Back Off Boogaloo\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows.  He also narrated the first two series of the children's television programme Thomas & Friends and portrayed \"Mr Conductor\" during the first season of the PBS children's television series Shining Time Station. Since 1989, he has toured with thirteen variations of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band.\nStarr's musicianship has received praise from other drummers, including Phil Collins and Journey's Steve Smith. He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2011, Rolling Stone readers named Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. Starr, who was previously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a Beatle in 1988, was inducted for his solo career in 2015, making him one of 21 performers inducted more than once. He is the richest drummer in the world with a net worth of US$350 million. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringo_Starr", "title": "Ringo Starr", "qa_pairs": [{"question":

privately met Kh\u00e1nh at the latter's office. He complained about the dissolution of the HNC and said it did not accord with the values of the alliance and the loyalty Washington expected of Saigon. He added that the US could not cooperate with two governments at once: a military regime that held power while a civilian body took the responsibility. Kh\u00e1nh testily replied that Vietnam was not a satellite of the US and compared the situation to the US support of the successful coup against Di\u1ec7m, saying that loyalty was meant to be reciprocated. Kh\u00e1nh had hinted that he felt the Americans were about to have him deposed like Di\u1ec7m, who was then assassinated, but this rankled Taylor, who had argued against the regime change. Taylor then bemoaned Kh\u00e1nh, saying he had lost confidence in the Vietnamese officer, recommending Kh\u00e1nh resign and go into exile. He also said military supplies currently being shipped to Vietnam would be withheld after arriving in Saigon and that American help in planning and advising military operations would be suspended.Kh\u00e1nh bristled and said \"You should keep to your place as Ambassador ... as Ambassador, it is really not appropriate for you to be dealing in this way with the commander-in-chief of the armed forces on a political matter, nor was it appropriate for you to have summoned some of my generals to the Embassy yesterday.\" He threatened to expel Taylor, who responded by saying a forced departure would mean the end of US support. However, Kh\u00e1nh later said he was open to the possibility of going abroad and asked Taylor if he thought this would be good for the country, to which the ambassador replied in the affirmative. Kh\u00e1nh also said he took responsibility for his generals' actions, and expressed regret at what they had done. Kh\u00e1nh then ended the meeting, saying he would think about his future.Later, Kh\u00e1nh phoned Taylor from his office and expressed his desire to resign and go abroad along with several other generals, asking for the Americans to fund the travel costs. He then read Taylor the list of generals for whom arrangements needed to be made, and asked the ambassador to repeat the names for confirmation. Taylor did so, unaware Kh\u00e1nh was taping the dialogue. Afterwards, Kh\u00e1nh played the tape out of context to his colleagues, giving them the impression Taylor was calling for their expulsion from their own country. Kh\u00e1nh then asked his colleagues to participate in a campaign of fomenting anti-American street protests and to give the impression the country did not need Washington's aid. A CIA informant reported the recent arguments with Taylor had incensed the volatile Thi so much that he had privately vowed to \"blow up everything\" and \"kill Phan Kh\u1eafc S\u1eedu, Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng and Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh and put an end to all this.

In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29\u201330 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \"echo\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810\u20131873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (n\u00e9e Gibbes, 1817\u20131858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787\u20131873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828\u20131897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead.\nAugustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s.

This tactic allowed the Spanish to break through the pass and storm the entrance of the city.

The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \"Denise Waverly\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit.\nDenise (formerly Edna) moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting they become romantically involved. She also reunites with Doris. Denise offers to and writes a song specifically for Doris and her two girlfriends, persuading Milner to audition and hire the group. \nIn 1965, Howard and Denise begin writing together; they pen a song called \"Unwanted Number,\" based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy.

By the early 1920s, developments in jazz saw the rise of the jazz soloist, with solos becoming longer and more complex. Both Beiderbecke and Armstrong were key figures in this evolution, as can be heard on their earliest recordings. According to the critic Terry Teachout, they are \"the two most influential figures in the early history of jazz\" and \"the twin lines of descent from which most of today's jazz can be traced.\"Beiderbecke's cornet style is often described by contrasting it with Armstrong's markedly different approach. Armstrong was a virtuoso on his instrument, and his solos often took advantage of that fact. Beiderbecke was largely, although not completely, self-taught, and the constraints imposed by that fact were evident in his music. While Armstrong often soared into the upper register, Beiderbecke stayed in the middle range, more interested in exploring the melody and harmonies than in dazzling the audience. Armstrong often emphasized the performance aspect of his playing, while Beiderbecke tended to stare at his feet while playing, uninterested in personally engaging his listeners. Armstrong was deeply influenced by the blues, while Beiderbecke was influenced as much by modernist composers such as Debussy and Ravel as by his fellow jazzmen.Beiderbecke's most famous solo was on \"Singin' the Blues\", recorded February 4, 1927. It has been hailed as an important example of the \"jazz ballad style\"\u2014\"a slow or medium-tempo piece played gently and sweetly, but not cloyingly, with no loss of muscle.\" The tune's laid-back emotions hinted at what would become, in the 1950s, the cool jazz style, personified by Chet Baker and Bill Evans. More than that, though, \"Singin' the Blues\" has been noted for the way its improvisations feel less improvised than composed, with each phrase building on the last in a logical fashion. Benny Green describes the solo's effect on practiced ears:\nWhen a musician hears Bix's solo on 'Singing the Blues', he becomes aware after two bars that the soloist knows exactly what he is doing and that he has an exquisite sense of discord and resolution. He knows also that this player is endowed with the rarest jazz gift of all, a sense of form which lends to an improvised performance a coherence which no amount of teaching can produce. The listening musician, whatever his generation or his style, recognizes Bix as a modern, modernism being not a style but an attitude.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bix_Beiderbecke", "title": "Bix Beiderbecke", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the song that has been noted for the way its improvisations feel less improvised than composed by the artist that largely self-taught?", "query_id": "450268092561493f72f8f1138b5e933bac34e649", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Singin' the Blues"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Singin' the Blues", "answer_start": 1498}]}, {"question": "What are last names of the modernist composers that influenced the artist that was largely self-taught?", "query_id": "3ce2807b8d01517310e285e6fbc358851b1f8e16", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Debussy", "Ravel"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Debussy", "answer_start": 1416}, {"text": "Ravel", "answer_start": 1428}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the solo work that is an important example of the \"jazz ballad style\"?", "query_id": "925af6c7c5c916fc2012a7faa31db1e38e67e224", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Singin' the Blues"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Singin' the Blues", "answer_start": 1498}]}]}, "3ed08986704039c74c3c13c3b0dc7c1cce5bd151": {"passage": "In 1932, a luxury yacht is sailing through a channel off the western coast of South America. The captain is worried about the channel lights not matching the charts, but is quickly dissuaded from changing course by the wealthy passengers for the sake of time, including famous big game hunter and author Bob Rainsford. It is a calm evening, with the cheerful passengers relaxing over drinks and a game of cards. Bob and his companions are debating about whether hunting is at all sporting for the animal being hunted after a friend asks if he would exchange places with a tiger he had recently hunted in Africa. Bob replies that there are two kinds of people in the world: those who hunt and those who are hunted.\nThe ship suddenly runs aground, causing the ship to take on water and heave violently. Water floods the boiler room, causing the ship to explode and sink into the channel. Rainsford and two others manage to get away and cling to wreckage, but the other survivors are eaten by a shark. He swims to a small, lush island. Wandering through the jungle, he sees the channel lights off the shoreline change, and suspects the ship was deliberately led off course to its doom.\nHe stumbles across a luxury chateau where he becomes the guest of the expatriate Russian Count Zaroff, a fellow hunting enthusiast. Zaroff remarks that Rainsford's misfortune is not uncommon; in fact, four people from the previous sinking are still staying with him: Eve Trowbridge, her brother Martin, and two sailors.\nThat night, Zaroff introduces Rainsford to the Trowbridges and reveals his obsession with hunting. During one of his hunts, a Cape buffalo inflicted a head wound on him. He eventually became bored with the sport, to his great consternation, until he discovered \"the most dangerous game\" on his island.

Van der Weyden was born Roger de la Pasture in Tournai. The German Hans Memling and the Estonian Michael Sittow both worked in the Netherlands in a fully Netherlandish style. Simon Marmion is often regarded as an Early Netherlandish painter because he came from Amiens, an area intermittently ruled by the Burgundian court between 1435 and 1471. The Burgundian duchy was at its peak influence, and the innovations made by the Netherlandish painters were soon recognised across the continent. By the time of van Eyck's death, his paintings were sought by wealthy patrons across Europe. Copies of his works were widely circulated, a fact that greatly contributed to the spread of the Netherlandish style to central and southern Europe. Central European art was then under the dual influence of innovations from Italy and from the north. Often the exchange of ideas between the Low Countries and Italy led to patronage from nobility such as Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, who commissioned manuscripts from both traditions.The first generation were literate, well educated and mostly from middle-class backgrounds. Van Eyck and van der Weyden were both highly placed in the Burgundian court, with van Eyck in particular assuming roles for which an ability to read Latin was necessary; inscriptions found on his panels indicate that he had a good knowledge of both Latin and Greek. A number of artists were financially successful and much sought-after in the Low Countries and by patrons across Europe. Many artists, including David and Bouts, could afford to donate large works to the churches, monasteries and convents of their choosing. Van Eyck was a valet de chambre at the Burgundian court and had easy access to Philip the Good.

Meanwhile, proponents of protecting the region kept up their efforts. In 1910, under the influence of the Boone and Crockett Club, spearheaded by Club members George Bird Grinnell, Henry L. Stimson, and the railroad, a bill was introduced into the U.S. Congress which redesignated the region from a forest reserve to a national park. This bill was signed into law by President William Howard Taft on May 11, 1910. In 1910 George Bird Grinnell wrote, \"This Park, the country owes to the Boone and Crockett Club, whose members discovered the region, suggested it being set aside, caused the bill to be introduced into congress and awakened interest in it all over the country\".\nFrom May until August 1910, the forest reserve supervisor, Fremont Nathan Haines, managed the park's resources as the first acting superintendent. In August 1910, William Logan was appointed the park's first superintendent. While the designation of the forest reserve confirmed the traditional usage rights of the Blackfeet, the enabling legislation of the national park does not mention the guarantees to the Native Americans. It is the position of the United States government that with the special designation as a National Park the mountains ceded their multi-purpose public land status and the former rights ceased to exist as it was confirmed by the Court of Claims in 1935. Some Blackfeet held that their traditional usage rights still exist de jure. In the 1890s, armed standoffs were avoided narrowly several times.The Great Northern Railway, under the supervision of president Louis W. Hill, built a number of hotels and chalets throughout the park in the 1910s to promote tourism.  These buildings, constructed and operated by a Great Northern subsidiary called the Glacier Park Company, were modeled on Swiss architecture as part of Hill's plan to portray Glacier as \"America's Switzerland\". Hill was especially interested in sponsoring artists to come to the park, building tourist lodges that displayed their work.  His hotels in the park never made a profit but they attracted thousands of visitors who came via the Great Northern. Vacationers commonly took pack trips on horseback between the lodges or utilized the seasonal stagecoach routes to gain access to the Many Glacier area in the northeast.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier_National_Park_(U.S.)", "title": "Glacier National Park (U.S.)", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the first name of the person whose plan was to portray Glacier as \"American's Switzerland?\"", "query_id": "2fe145746740bc363b62ab47eb0c45f68f44a310", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Louis"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Louis", "answer_start": 2035}]}, {"question": "What were the full names of two of the Boone ad Crockett Club members?", "query_id": "11caa3f4f7d9c00b48f15f21bf4934d3f8ef35b5", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Grinnell", "George Bird Grinnell", "Henry L.

Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto\u2014he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role.\nToto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \"I Will Remember\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing almost every track starting in the late 1980s. Lukather admitted that the reason why he has no songwriting contributions on the first two Toto albums was that he wasn't writing many songs at the time, because he was intimidated by the talent of the band's chief songwriter, David Paich. He credits Paich himself with encouraging him to contribute more songs to the band. He wrote very few of Toto's songs by himself, an exception being the hit single \"I Won't Hold You Back\" from Toto IV. Lukather has said that writing lyrics is not one of his strengths. Thus, he collaborated with other band members to complete song ideas and make them into viable album tracks. Lukather's official site claims he contributed to writing all of the songs on Toto's 2006 album Falling in Between, even though \"Spiritual Man\" officially credits Paich as the sole writer.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Lukather", "title": "Steve Lukather", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the person that took over the vocalist role after the dismissal of Jean-Michel Byron?", "query_id": "13be56cc746446f6ff978ffeec6413baa95a7105", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Lukather"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Lukather", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "What was the name of the person that performed the lead vocals on the album, Kingdom of Desire?", "query_id": "3c8b261b450b442c10db18445251af716afc7bca", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Lukather"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Lukather", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "What was the full name of the person that intimidated Lukather?", "query_id": "a4bafdca6bc830ccb09047323f405cdee60b1830", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["David Paich"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "David Paich", "answer_start": 267}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person that wrote I Won't Hold You Back?", "query_id": "cf52cb92d578dee9eca3be32739677f9170e9d42", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Lukather"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Lukather", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the person David encouraged to write more songs for the band?", "query_id": "80bd5894e687d70468141a284f119c0a85f6f583", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Lukather"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Lukather", "answer_start": 2088}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the person who collaborated with other band members to complete song ideas and make them into viable album tracks?

Radically different from previous treatments of the subject, it shows a lone blindfolded female figure sitting on a globe, playing a lyre that has only a single string remaining. The background is almost blank, its only visible feature a single star. Watts intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous. While his use of colour in Hope was greatly admired, at the time of its exhibition many critics disliked the painting. Hope proved popular with the Aesthetic Movement, who considered beauty the primary purpose of art and were unconcerned by the ambiguity of its message. Reproductions in platinotype, and later cheap carbon prints, soon began to be sold.\nAlthough Watts received many offers to buy the painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt it would be inappropriate not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.\nAs cheap reproductions of Hope, and from 1908 high-quality prints, began to circulate in large quantities, it became a widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.\nDespite the decline in Watts's popularity, Hope remained influential. Martin Luther King Jr. based a 1959 sermon, now known as Shattered Dreams, on the theme of the painting, as did Jeremiah Wright in Chicago in 1990. Among the congregation for the latter was the young Barack Obama, who was deeply moved. Obama took \"The Audacity of Hope\" as the theme of his 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address, and as the title of his 2006 book; he based his successful 2008 presidential campaign around the theme of \"Hope\".", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_(painting)", "title": "Hope (painting)", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the first name of the person who intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous?", "query_id": "faed9cf32cd6eb5769dff6cf37ad154b75446994", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["George"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "George", "answer_start": 56}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who received many offers to buy the painting?", "query_id": "5b64a77d397679e504dac036193d94ccb3addad8", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["George"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "George", "answer_start": 56}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who painted a second version of Hope with an assistant?", "query_id": "6c4dfb92aeb76f86fb06b274670b5d69525c02a1", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["George"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "George", "answer_start": 56}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum?", "query_id": "4149e8ba8c3eb104f48afda39ed390e23634a967", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["George"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "George", "answer_start": 56}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who painted at least two further versions of Hope for private sale?", "query_id": "d246102c23dbc935bf079b95c77c4af988cee1b6", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["George"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "George", "answer_start": 56}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of person who intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous?", "query_id": "107c7173ac19b17b603213c59a7dd8ca885eb8df", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["George Frederic Watts"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "George Frederic Watts", "answer_start": 56}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who painted at least two further versions for private sale?", "query_id": "6adab28608700deb4364cfcc9b1a0720f62f3ee6", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Watts"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Watts", "answer_start": 1132}]}, {"question": "Among whose congregation was the young Barack Obama?", "query_id": "7f9f9793cc5ae0bd9fd17541db8fb216dfe190fb", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Jeremiah Wright"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Jeremiah Wright", "answer_start": 2106}]}]}, "ece00b5b83768c67a8c27264c0f0fa85411684e4": {"passage": "Pearl Jam commenced work on a new album following a year-long break after its full-scale tour in support of Binaural. McCready described the recording environment as \"a pretty positive one\" and \"very intense and spiritual.\" Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, \"There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed.\" Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles \"I Am Mine\" and \"Save You\". The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as \"Love Boat Captain\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said \"Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogy\u2014a muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours.\" The track entitled \"Arc\" was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.In 2003, the band embarked on its Riot Act Tour, which included tours in Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its official website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: Perth, Tokyo, State College, Pennsylvania, two shows from Madison Square Garden, and Mansfield, Massachusetts. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed Riot Act's \"Bu$hleaguer\", a commentary on President George W. Bush, with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had \"impaled\" the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band's Denver, Colorado show.In June 2003, Pearl Jam announced it was officially leaving Epic Records following the end of its contract with the label. The band stated it had \"no interest\" in signing with another label. The band's first release without a label was the single for \"Man of the Hour\", in partnership with Amazon.com. Director Tim Burton approached Pearl Jam to request an original song for the soundtrack of his new film, Big Fish.

After training in singing, strings playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as suonatore di vivuola (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga's court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga's maestro della musica (master of music) in 1601.Vincenzo Gonzaga's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio\u2014a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas\u2014into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by Jacopo Corsi, these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera: Dafne, composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period\u2014Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo by Emilio de' Cavalieri, Peri's Euridice and Giulio Caccini's identically titled Euridice\u2014survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses, and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo.The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo's time the court had staged Angelo Poliziano's lyrical drama La favola di Orfeo, at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court's musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini's play Il pastor fido, described by theatre historian Mark Ringer as a \"watershed theatrical work\" which inspired the Italian craze for pastoral drama. On 6 October 1600, while visiting Florence for the wedding of Maria de' Medici to King Henry IV of France, Duke Vincenzo attended a production of Peri's Euridice. It is likely that his principal musicians, including Monteverdi, were also present at this performance. The Duke quickly recognised the novelty of this new form of dramatic entertainment, and its potential for bringing prestige to those prepared to sponsor it.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Orfeo", "title": "L'Orfeo", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What are the specific titles of the two separate works with identical names that were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses?

After listening to the orchestral demo, the band worked on the key and tempo. Garbage used a portable studio from a number of European cities to record material for Arnold, keeping in touch by phone as he produced the song's string arrangement in London. Since the strings carried the structure of the song, they had to be finalised and recorded before Manson could sing her parts. Arnold recorded the strings with a 60-piece orchestra in one day at London's Metropolis Studios.\nGarbage flew to London for a day to record the basic tracks, laying down electric guitar, bass guitar and Manson's vocals with the orchestra. Manson called working with the orchestra \"exhilarating\". That night, the band flew to Switzerland to resume their tour for three weeks. \nThe final recording was made in August at Armoury Studios in Vancouver, Canada, where Garbage built upon their first mix of the song, adding and subtracting parts, and completed final recording and mixing. The band kept the arrangement tight to preserve the song's dynamic, sweeping melody. \"The orchestra took up so much space and really dictated where the song was going dynamically,\" keeping the recording simple, Vig recalled. \"Besides the drums and bass and some percussive loops, there's a little bit of guitar that Duke and Steve did. There's not a lot of miscellaneous tracks on there. There's a few little ear-candy things that we did, but it's all meant to work around Shirley's singing.\" Although Garbage owned its own recording studio in Madison, Wisconsin, for legal reasons the song could not be recorded in a U.S. studio. \"The World Is Not Enough\" was completed, mixed and mastered at the end of the month, and the group returned to their recording studio in Madison to record their mix of the song. Garbage's version (the \"chilled-out remix\") downplayed the classic Bond sound in favour of the band's style. Vig later said about the original recording, \"We're pretty pleased with how it turned out. To Garbage fans, it sounds like a Garbage song. And to Bond fans, it's a Bond song.\"  However, Manson noted that the version featured in the film \u201cgot our hopes and joys squashed,\u201d as \u201cthey had completely screwed with all the stems of mix and it sounded completely different.\u201d ", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Is_Not_Enough_(song)", "title": "\"The World Is Not Enough\" (song)", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the song whose string arrangement was produced in London?", "query_id": "f84601996229e760f3cbf19ad96b026eb717415c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The World Is Not Enough"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The World Is Not Enough", "answer_start": 1688}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the song for which the strings carried the structure?", "query_id": "c5dd8407678cfbed10801153680692bcaff8c883", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The World Is Not Enough"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The World Is Not Enough", "answer_start": 1688}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the song for which Garbage's first mix was built upon in the final recording made in August at Armoury Studios in Vancouver, Canada?", "query_id": "814f6343fdc6f2e2e8ae2bef3aa302e31085eb74", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The World Is Not Enough"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The World Is Not Enough", "answer_start": 1688}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the song whose dynamic sweeping melody the band wanted to preserve?", "query_id": "263e08993e7e8c2055f405543b6218c07e15f3ca", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The World Is Not Enough"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The World Is Not Enough", "answer_start": 1688}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the song that reportedly could not be recorded in a U.S. studio for legal reasons?", "query_id": "dc10bb4f54d53af94f24a1b13c57514412f93736", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The World Is Not Enough"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The World Is Not Enough", "answer_start": 1688}]}]}, "a54d1f27a512d6fa91ad9f4a6874537d19b2ca4d": {"passage": "A young American man arrives in Palermo by plane.

The majority becomes increasingly unhappy with Frank's position, as he seems opposed to every new idea. Frank also dispenses justice on his own in the old Sicilian fashion, without seeking approval from the others. They, not being of Sicilian origin, are trying to leave behind the old traditional methods, such as when two of Frank's hit men kill a stool pigeon in the marshes and leave him tied to a chair with a canary stuffed in his mouth, as a warning to others who might talk too much.\nFrank still fondly remembers his father, who also was a mafioso who was assassinated in a hit.

They likely represent a fused tradition of European and Mediterranean cultures. The boar is said to have been sacred to a mother goddess figure among linguistically Celtic communities in Iron Age Europe, while the Roman historian Tacitus, writing around the first century AD, suggested that the Baltic Aesti wore boar symbols in battle to invoke her protection. Boar-crested helmets are depicted on the turn-of-the-millennium Gundestrup cauldron, discovered in Denmark, and on a Torslunda plate from Sweden, made some five hundred years later. Though the Romans also included the boar in their stable of symbols\u2014four legions, including the twentieth, adopted it as their emblem\u2014it was only one among many. The boar nonetheless persisted in continental Germanic tradition during the nearly 400 years of Roman rule in Britain, such as in association with the Scandinavian gods Freyja and Freyr. Its return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period, as represented by the boars from Benty Grange, Wollaston, Guilden Morden, and Horncastle, may therefore suggest the post-Roman reintroduction of a Germanic tradition from Europe, rather than the continuation of a tradition in Britain through 400 years of Roman rule.

Waldo then goes home to Kansas to be with on-again, off-again girlfriend Maude and her family. Maude, however, is not happy to see Waldo at first; because every time he returns from a barnstorming tour of the country, he is injured in some way. Eventually, however, they make up and become lovers once again. Meanwhile, Maude's brother Ezra, a long-time friend of Waldo's since boyhood, promises to build Waldo a high-performance monoplane as soon as he is well enough to fly it.

Such cities are characterized by their ethnic clustering, network of international connectivity, and convergence of technological innovation. Global cities, such as San Francisco, are considered to be complex and require a high level of talent as well as large masses of low wage workers. A divide is created within the city of ethnic, typically lower-class neighborhoods, and expensive ones with newly developed buildings. This in turn creates a population of highly educated, white-collar individuals as well as blue-collar workers, many of whom are immigrants, and who both are drawn to the increasing number of opportunities available. Competition for these opportunities pushes growth and adaptation in world centers.San Francisco has a diversified service economy, with employment spread across a wide range of professional services, including financial services, tourism, and (increasingly) high technology. In 2016, approximately 27% of workers were employed in professional business services; 14% in leisure and hospitality; 13% in government services; 12% in education and health care; 11% in trade, transportation, and utilities; and 8% in financial activities. In 2017, GDP in the five-county San Francisco metropolitan area grew 3.4% to $501 billion. Additionally, in 2017 the 14-county San Jose\u2013San Francisco\u2013Oakland combined statistical area had a GDP of $907 billion, ranking 3rd among CSAs, and ahead of all but 16 countries. As of 2017, San Francisco County was the 7th highest-income county in the United States (among 3,142), with a per capita personal income of $119,868.

The songs performed for the album were arranged by Monk, who reworked four of his earlier compositions. In the album's liner notes, Keepnews wrote of Monk's approach to arrangements: \"It should be axiomatic that Monk is a constantly self-renewing composer-arranger-musician, that each new recording of an 'old' number, particularly with different personnel, represents a fresh view of it\u2014almost a new composition.\" In the producer's opinion, Monk played the piano more vividly and less introspectively than on his studio recordings in response to the enthusiastic crowds he drew nightly to the venue.On \"Nutty\", Griffin incorporated lines from \"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" and exhibited a frenetic swing that was complemented by counterplay from Haynes and Monk. \"Blues Five Spot\", a new composition by Monk for the album, is a twelve-bar blues homage to the Five Spot Caf\u00e9 and featured solos from each player. Griffin and Monk transfigured chord structures and melodies throughout the performance. Griffin's solo vamp maintained the rhythm while quoting lines from other pieces, including the theme song for the animated Popeye theatrical shorts; he played \"The Sailor's Hornpipe\" at the end of \"Blues Five Spot\".\nThe quartet began \"In Walked Bud\" with an eight-bar piano intro and thirty-two-bar form. Griffin began his solo a minute into the song with saxophone wails. In the third minute, Monk did not play, while Griffin played fast phrases at the top of his register with intermittently slower R&B and free jazz elements. Monk shouted approvingly throughout Griffin's solo before he resumed piano and played a two-minute theme. \"Just a Gigolo\", a standard, was the only song on the album not composed by Monk, who performed it in a brief, unaccompanied version. It was played as a single chorus repeated at length.The title track\u2014first recorded for Blue Note Records in 1948 with vibraphonist Milt Jackson\u2014is one of Monk's most influential recordings and is based on a series of minor second clusters. His performance of the song at the Five Spot Caf\u00e9 showcased his idiosyncratic playing of one blue note next to another. Monk superimposed musical ideas that deviated from the song's original tonal center, adding a C blue note to the D-flat blue note. Haynes' subdued drumming backed Griffin's aggressive bop playing and extended solo on \"Misterioso\".", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misterioso_(Thelonious_Monk_album)", "title": "Misterioso (Thelonious Monk album)", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What are the titles of the songs on the record Misterioso?", "query_id": "8a64004c451f3b32cad6a53368450e247fb93c04", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Nutty", "Blues Five Spot", "The Sailor's Hornpipe", "In Walked Bud", "Just a Gigolo", "The Surrey with the Fringe on Top"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Nutty", "answer_start": 676}, {"text": "Blues Five Spot", "answer_start": 843}, {"text": "The Sailor's Hornpipe", "answer_start": 1238}, {"text": "In Walked Bud", "answer_start": 1313}, {"text": "Just a Gigolo", "answer_start": 1714}, {"text": "The Surrey with the Fringe on Top", "answer_start": 717}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the song on Misterioso that was not written by Monk?", "query_id": "9a70e70531bfb109c6f929d57d63052aeca8f1cd", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Just a Gigolo"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Just a Gigolo", "answer_start": 1714}]}, {"question": "What year was Just a Gigolo first recorded?", "query_id": "2027fd20e95a07df6e9b6646245d9e150a7ad815", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["1948"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "1948", "answer_start": 1955}]}]}, "65a7286eed002e82649e7c992cb90ffc7b442c72": {"passage": "Soon after the end of World War II a young English woman, Amy Atkins, goes back to the London flat where she and her best friend, Tillie Grey, once used to live.

The shallowness of the lagoon makes it suitable habitat for diving birds such as anhinga, cormorants and diving ducks. The bay also provides habitat for juvenile sea animals that have left the shelter of the mangrove belts.  Manatees frequent the quiet waters of the bay. The bay has a year-round population of double-crested cormorants. Winter residents include northern gannets, American white pelicans and common loons. The bay also has a resident population of common bottlenose dolphins.Biscayne Bay is a shallow lagoon with little vertical density or salinity gradient due to its lack of depth. Instead of a vertical gradient, the bay shows a horizontal density gradient, with fresh water entering from the drainage canals on the west side and seawater entering through gaps in the keys and through the safety valve section of shoals. Bay salinity reaches a peak in June. Changes in the salinity pattern of the bay have had negative effects on formerly abundant species such as red drum. Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay are major nurseries for red grouper and gray snapper. The bottom of the lagoon hosts sponges and soft corals in places where grasses cannot not grow. Three primary species of seagrass are found in the park: turtlegrass, shoal grass and manatee grass. The endangered Johnson's seagrass is also found in small quantities in the bay, which is at the southern end of the grass's range. Roughly 75 percent of the central bay floor is covered by grasses. Scarring of seagrass beds by vessel groundings or propellers is a significant problem. About 200 such incidents are documented each year, with full re-growth requiring up to 15 years.

He then took Daniel Porter Fordham into partnership and practised as Douglas & Fordham. Fordham was born around 1846 and had been an assistant in Douglas's office since at least 1872. In 1898, having developed consumption, Fordham retired from the practice and went to live in Bournemouth where he died the following year. He was replaced as partner by Charles Howard Minshull, who had been born in Chester in 1858 and who became articled to Douglas in 1874; the practice became Douglas & Minshull. During the first decade of the 20th century, Douglas became less active but, for reasons which are unknown, the partnership was dissolved in 1909. The practice returned to the title of John Douglas, Architect. Minshull went into partnership with E. J. Muspratt in Foregate Street, Chester. When Douglas died, this partnership worked from the Abbey Square address as Douglas, Minshull & Muspratt.Little is known about Douglas's private life and personality. Only two images of him are known to survive. One is a photograph taken in later middle age. The other is a caricature sketch made by an assistant in his office. This shows him in old age, bowed, bent and bespectacled, carrying a portfolio and an ear trumpet. According to architectural historian Edward Hubbard, Douglas's life \"seems to have been one of thorough devotion to architecture ... which may well have been intensified by the death of his wife and other domestic worries\". His obituary in the Chester Chronicle stated that he \"lived heart and soul in his profession\".Douglas was a dedicated Christian who regularly attended his local church, St Paul's Church, Boughton, a church he rebuilt. His house, Walmoor Hill, included an oratory. He also had a \"strong sense of national loyalty\", incorporating statues of Queen Victoria in niches at Walmoor Hill and in his buildings in St Werburgh Street, Chester. Douglas was not good at handling the financial matters of his practice. The Duke of Westminster's secretary wrote of him in 1884, \"A good architect but a poor hand at accounts!\". Delay in presenting his accounts often led to difficulties and confusion; such delay sometimes amounted to as much as ten years. Otherwise very little is known about his personal life.

With 83 million inhabitants, it is the second most populous state of Europe after Russia, the most populous state lying entirely in Europe, as well as the most populous member state of the European Union.

The school taught students ages 16 to 35 in crop and livestock care. In 1902, the school moved to a larger location near Poughkeepsie and closed a year later due to a lack of funding. In addition, Briarcliff Manor has been the location for several colleges. Briarcliff Junior College was founded in 1903 at the Briarcliff Lodge, and moved near Briarcliff Congregational Church, on land Walter Law donated, in 1905. Among its trustees were Howard Deering Johnson, Norman Cousins, Carl Carmer, Thomas K. Finletter, William Zorach, Eduard C. Lindeman, and Lyman Bryson. Ordway Tead was chairman of the board of trustees, and his wife Clara was the college's first president. The school gradually improved its academic scope and standing, and was registered with the State Education Department and accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 1944. In 1951, the Board of Regents authorized the college to grant Associate of Arts and Associate of Applied Science degrees. The following year, the Army Map Service selected the college as the only one in the country for professional training in cartography. In 1956, the junior college started issuing bachelor's degrees, and became known as Briarcliff College. In 1977 Pace University bought Briarcliff College and the Spanish Renaissance-style Briarcliff Grade School building, incorporating them into its Pleasantville campus. The Briarcliff Grade School building, which housed the village public school from 1909 to 1980, became known as the Pace University Village Center.

This was partially because of bassist Cliff Burton's knowledge of music theory. He showed Hetfield how to augment core notes with complementary counter-melodies and how basic guitar harmony worked, which reflected on the song compositions. Hetfield developed more socially aware lyrics, as well as ominous and semi-philosophical references. Ulrich explained that Metallica opted not to rely strictly on fast tempos as on the previous album, but to explore other musical approaches that sounded powerful and heavy. Grinder magazine's Kevin Fisher summarized the album as \"ultimate thrash, destruction and total blur\" that reminded him of the speed and power of Kill 'Em All. Music journalist Martin Popoff observed that Ride the Lightning offered \"sophistication and brutality in equal measure\" and was seen as something new at the time of its release. Discussing the album's lyrical content, philosopher William Irwin wrote: \"After Kill 'Em All, the rebellion and aggression became much more focused as the enemy became more clearly defined. Metallica was deeply concerned about various domains in which the common man was wrongfully yet ingeniously deceived. More precisely, they were highly critical of those in power\".\nThe major-key acoustic introduction to \"Fight Fire with Fire\" displayed Metallica's evolution towards a more harmonically complex style of songwriting. The fastest Metallica song in terms of picking speed, it is driven by nimbly tremolo-picked riffs in the verses and chorus. The extended solo at the end dissolves in a sound effect of a vast nuclear explosion. The main riff was taped during the Kill 'Em All Tour and the acoustic intro was something Burton was playing on acoustic guitar at the time. The song discouraged the \"eye for an eye\" approach, and its lyrical themes focused on nuclear warfare and Armageddon. \"Ride the Lightning\" was Metallica's first song to emphasize the misery of the criminal justice system. The lyrics were written from the perspective of someone who is anticipating execution by the electric chair. The song, one of the two album tracks that credited Mustaine, begins in a mid-tempo which gradually accelerates as the song progress. It features an instrumental middle section highlighted by Hammett's soloing. According to Hetfield, the song was not a criticism of capital punishment, but a tale of a man sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit, as in the opening lyrics: \"Guilty as charged/But Damn it/It ain't right\".", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ride_the_Lightning", "title": "Ride the Lightning", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the fastest picking speed song by the band that recorded Kill 'Em All?", "query_id": "9f14485f01007aca05183f3fafda1ce811d6efe5", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Fight Fire with Fire"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Fight Fire with Fire", "answer_start": 1437}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person that was credited with the song that was about the misery of the criminal justice system?", "query_id": "c273771f34d3b3c423e2428d3b1186882d4f149c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Mustaine"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Mustaine", "answer_start": 2283}]}]}, "e767f8b1f62033644b64dfb5de60a46da124edd8": {"passage": "Love.

The album combines music genres such as electropop, new wave, dance-rock, soul, hip hop, R&B, and disco. Several songs employ synthesizer sounds characteristic of music from the 1980s, drawing comparisons to The Go-Go's and Cyndi Lauper. Stefani cited Club Nouveau, Depeche Mode, Lisa Lisa, Prince, New Order, The Cure, and early Madonna as major influences for the album.Like pop albums of the 1980s, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. focuses primarily on money, with songs such as \"Rich Girl\" and \"Luxurious\" that feature descriptions of riches and wealth. The album contains several references to Stefani's clothing line, L.A.M.B., and alludes to contemporary fashion designers such as John Galliano, Rei Kawakubo, and Vivienne Westwood. Stefani also released a series of dolls named the \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby. Fashion Dolls\", designed after the costumes from her tour. Although Stefani intended for the album to be a light dance record, she stated that \"no matter what you do, things just come out.\" The album's opening track \"What You Waiting For?\" discusses her desire to be a mother and in 2006, she and her then husband, Bush singer Gavin Rossdale, had a son named Kingston Rossdale. The fourth track \"Cool\" discusses Stefani's friendship with Kanal after he ended a romantic relationship with her in 1995.Love. Angel. Music.

The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \"Waterloo Sunset\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \"the most beautiful song in the English language\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\".\nThe songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \"Death of a Clown\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, \"Autumn Almanac\", in early October. Backed with \"Mister Pleasant\", the single became another Top 5 success for the group. Andy Miller points out that, despite its success, the single marks a turning point in the band's career\u2014it would be their last entry into the UK Top Ten for three years: \"In retrospect, 'Autumn Almanac' marked the first hint of trouble for the Kinks. This glorious single, one of the greatest achievements of British 60s pop, was widely criticised at the time for being too similar to previous Davies efforts.\" Nick Jones of Melody Maker asked, \"Is it time that Ray stopped writing about grey suburbanites going about their fairly unemotional daily business? ... Ray works to a formula, not a feeling, and it's becoming rather boring.\" Disc jockey Mike Ahern called the song \"a load of old rubbish\".

Douglas-fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. Lodgepole Pines\u2014the most common tree species in the park\u2014generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Whitebark Pine, and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by lightning, while another six to ten are started by people\u2014in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive exhibits and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September\u2014the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acres (40 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park", "title": "Yellowstone National Park", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Where is Mount Washburn?", "query_id": "07a18f5ebed8fa409ee9e8e63bc96a936abc5844", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Yellowstone National Park"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Yellowstone National Park", "answer_start": 1238}]}, {"question": "What is located on top of Mount Washburn?", "query_id": "2a398f20e458252b46b798917c7b6c05e7b5f3b0", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["fire lookout tower"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "fire lookout tower", "answer_start": 1274}]}]}, "58c119091413abb76c1d6653dfbb6dd09feda85c": {"passage": "Charlie and Jimmy Chan are traveling by plane to San Francisco.

However, regulations have been introduced by the Swedish broadcasters. The competition's official rules are released by SVT early in preparation for each year's Melodifestival, to ensure any changes are noted by songwriters and performers.\nThere was a limit of six people on stage for each performance. This included the Melodifestivalen choir (husk\u00f6ren, literally \"the house choir\"), a five-person group of flexible backing singers used by most participants. Artists could use some or all of the back-up singers, or use their own group. All vocals had to be completely live; human voices were not allowed on backing tracks. However, from 2009, the number of performers allowed on stage was eight, and voices were allowed on backing tracks. A live orchestra was used every year from the event's debut to 2000, except 1985 and 1986. Two orchestras were used between 1960 and 1963, a large orchestra and G\u00f6te Wilhelmsons kvartett, a jazz quartet. Since 2001, participants have performed to backing tracks.\nEntries cannot be publicly broadcast until the semi-finals are previewed on radio. Entries eliminated in the semi-finals may be broadcast as soon as the semi-final has finished. An embargo is placed on songs that qualify for the later rounds until the previews for the Second Chance are broadcast. After this, restrictions on the broadcast of contestant songs are lifted.Broadcasters sometimes make sweeping changes to winning songs before they go to Eurovision. For example, at Melodifestivalen 1961, Siw Malmkvist won with \"April, April\". Performing after her victory, she stumbled on the lyrics of the song and laughed out loud. The press criticised this as childish. SR replaced her with Lill-Babs for the Eurovision Song Contest. The 1987 winner \"Fyra bugg och en Coca Cola\", performed by Lotta Engberg, is another example; the song's title was changed to \"Boogaloo\" for Eurovision, as use of a brand name was against the Contest's rules. This name was chosen as Sweden's two previous Eurovision winners had also included the suffix \"-loo\".Until 1999, competing songs were only permitted in Swedish, apart from 1965, 1973, 1974, 1975. This did not stop most winning entries recording English (and other language) versions of their songs. Since the abolition of Eurovision's language restrictions in 1999, regardless of the performance language at Melodifestivalen, every Swedish entry has been in English. Spanish, French, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Bosnian and Persian are among the other languages to have featured.

Bob the householder decides to go looking for Shane to ask him to turn down the volume. Bob can not find Shane, who is away buying more alcohol for the unexpected guests, and finds himself in what presumably is the master bedroom.

They come up against the silence of the boys and their parents, who do everything to protect them. The community is also opposed to Katy because they feel she is persecuting innocent young people.

On 8 February she entered McMurdo Sound and later that day anchored in a spot near its southern limit which was afterwards christened Winter Quarters Bay. Wilson wrote: \"We all realized our extreme good fortune in being led to such a winter quarter as this, safe for the ship, with perfect shelter from all ice pressure.\" Stoker Lashly, however, thought it looked \"a dreary place.\" Work began ashore with the erection of the expedition's huts on a rocky peninsula designated Hut Point. Scott had decided that the expedition should continue to live and work aboard ship, and he allowed Discovery to be frozen into the sea ice, leaving the main hut to be used as a storeroom and shelter.Of the entire party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any experience with dog-sledges. The results of the men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, and tended to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. The dangers of the unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. In their attempts to find safer ground, one of the group, Able Seaman George Vince, slid over the edge of a cliff and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still stands at the summit of the Hut Point promontory.During the winter months of May\u2013August the scientists were busy in their laboratories, while elsewhere equipment and stores were prepared for the next season's work. For relaxation there were amateur theatricals, and educational activities in the form of lectures. A newspaper, the South Polar Times, was edited by Shackleton. Outside pursuits did not cease altogether; there was football on the ice, and the schedule of magnetic and meteorological observations was maintained. As winter ended, trial sledge runs resumed, to test equipment and rations in advance of the planned southern journey which Scott, Wilson and Shackleton were to undertake. Meanwhile, a party under Royds travelled to Cape Crozier to leave a message at the post there, and discovered an emperor penguin colony. Another group, under Armitage, reconnoitred in the mountains to the west, returning in October with the expedition's first symptoms of scurvy. Armitage later blamed the outbreak on Scott's \"sentimental objection\" to the slaughter of animals for fresh meat.

Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple. Documents show weavers in Wervik paid taxes to Catherine Rapondi and in September 1434, when Michele Burlamacchi was tax collector in that town, van Eyck received a stipend funded by local tax receipts, suggesting a connection. Dhanens admits the donor's identity is lost, but she says of the piece that \"it could have been a gift from the husband to the wife, a pledge of his affection during his absences; or it could have been a gift from the wife to the husband, by way of protection on his travels.\"", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden_Triptych", "title": "Dresden Triptych", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the last name of the person who married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi?", "query_id": "9d2ac2f0464e314a358e0aacc62a4f096ee75a0f", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Rapondi"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Rapondi", "answer_start": 1551}]}, {"question": "What are the first names of the people in the couple that Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for?", "query_id": "154e5f7189cb8adf07299fd67bebfa9d93015572", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Catherine", "Michel"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Catherine", "answer_start": 1654}, {"text": "Michel", "answer_start": 1694}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who said \"it could have been a gift from the husband to the wife, a pledge of his affection during his absences; or it could have been a gift from the wife to the husband, by way of protection on his travels?\"", "query_id": "808c62bf22cc96d2e383898423f0ec8719438958", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Dhanens"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Dhanens", "answer_start": 1368}]}, {"question": "What is the belief that has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece?", "query_id": "3809df5c9f07df8519c578e2fa43afff06a8ee2c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant", "answer_start": 359}]}, {"question": "What was the first name of the person that historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437?", "query_id": "6c2414c0794df703f744f67ad5c8ac93d7f738f9", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Michele"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Michele", "answer_start": 972}]}, {"question": "What was the last name of the family whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine?", "query_id": "489aab41e69b28ca87963a0d6fc36a8d297ec261", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Rapondi"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Rapondi", "answer_start": 1551}]}, {"question": "What was the last name of the person who was a tax collector?", "query_id": "055a3d6e25c5c96f89443583689e8f6f3bf7d8d9", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Burlamacchi"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Burlamacchi", "answer_start": 1964}]}, {"question": "What was the last name of the person who married Michele Burlamacchi?", "query_id": "589eedaa098479ec2eb77eb2b4bdfccdadabcde5", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Rapondi"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Rapondi", "answer_start": 1920}]}, {"question": "What was the first name of the person Catherine could have given the piece to ask as gift by way of protection on his travels?", "query_id": "b969389198516b3f06d3eaee81dda15c32ddab0b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Michele"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Michele", "answer_start": 972}]}, {"question": "What was the first name of the person Michele could have given the piece to as a gift to pledge his affection during his absences?", "query_id": "ec88c74f6d044632c9ece55abd7e7bad38b2d675", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Catherine"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Catherine", "answer_start": 1491}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the people whose daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi?", "query_id": "eac8db9e1a82f2acf4e548bceee223176724c182", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Rapondi"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Rapondi", "answer_start": 1551}]}]}, "9c49999cbd18d34abac6396f1773555806ef631c": {"passage": "In 1867, Rubinstein handed over the directorship of the Conservatory to Zaremba. Later that year he resigned his conductorship of the Russian Music Society orchestra, to be replaced by Balakirev. Tchaikovsky had already promised his Characteristic Dances (then called Dances of the Hay Maidens) from his opera The Voyevoda to the society. In submitting the manuscript (and perhaps mindful of Cui's review of the cantata), Tchaikovsky included a note to Balakirev that ended with a request for a word of encouragement should the Dances not be performed.At this point The Five as a unit was dispersing. Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov wanted to remove themselves from Balakirev's influence, which they now found stifling, and go in their individual directions as composers. Balakirev might have sensed a potential new disciple in Tchaikovsky. He explained in his reply from Saint Petersburg that while he preferred to give his opinions in person and at length to press his points home, he was couching his reply \"with complete frankness\", adding, with a deft touch of flattery, that he felt that Tchaikovsky was \"a fully fledged artist\" and that he looked forward to discussing the piece with him on an upcoming trip to Moscow.These letters set the tone for Tchaikovsky's relationship with Balakirev over the next two years. At the end of this period, in 1869, Tchaikovsky was a 28-year-old professor at the Moscow Conservatory. Having written his first symphony and an opera, he next composed a symphonic poem entitled Fatum. Initially pleased with the piece when Nikolai Rubinstein conducted it in Moscow, Tchaikovsky dedicated it to Balakirev and sent it to him to conduct in Saint Petersburg. Fatum received only a lukewarm reception there. Balakirev wrote a detailed letter to Tchaikovsky in which he explained what he felt were defects in Fatum but also gave some encouragement. He added that he considered the dedication of the music to him as \"precious to me as a sign of your sympathy towards me\u2014and I feel a great weakness for you\". Tchaikovsky was too self-critical not to see the truth behind these comments. He accepted Balakirev's criticism, and the two continued to correspond. Tchaikovsky would later destroy the score of Fatum.

On his next album, Planet Waves, he used the Band as backing group, while rehearsing for a tour. The album included two versions of \"Forever Young\", which became one of his most popular songs. As one critic described it, the song projected \"something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan\", and Dylan himself commented: \"I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental.\"Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively covers), widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label. In January 1974, Dylan returned to touring after seven years; backed by the Band, he embarked on a North American tour of 40 concerts. A live double album, Before the Flood, was on Asylum Records. Soon, according to Clive Davis, Columbia Records sent word they \"will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold\". Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour, Geffen had sold only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves. Dylan returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums.\nAfter the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded an album entitled Blood on the Tracks in September 1974. Dylan delayed the release and re-recorded half the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.Released in early 1975, Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews. In the NME, Nick Kent described \"the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes.\" In Rolling Stone, Jon Landau wrote that \"the record has been made with typical shoddiness.\" Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements. In Salon.com, Bill Wyman wrote: \"Blood on the Tracks is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years.\" Novelist Rick Moody called it \"the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape.\"", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "title": "Bob Dylan", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the first name of the person who owns the company that had sold only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves?", "query_id": "d0bbe6c4c653a0e1af5a32aa49adfd2897674f50", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["David"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "David", "answer_start": 46}]}, {"question": "What did the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape?", "query_id": "3c8d8e96506f7eb31233b6bfd0ec615efaf2dd0f", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Blood on the Tracks"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Blood on the Tracks", "answer_start": 2075}]}]}, "85a4ffe83222dae632f9548354c6b7655c15e313": {"passage": "The Stooges are suitors who go on a sitdown strike at their fiancees' home when their prospective father-in-law refuses to consent the marriages.

They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451\u20131514) and Albrecht D\u00fcrer the Elder (c. 1427\u20131502), when she was around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of the physical and emotional effects of ageing. The D\u00fcrer family was close and D\u00fcrer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter.\nThey were created either as pendants, that is conceived as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation may have been a later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of D\u00fcrer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings D\u00fcrer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident.\nEach panel measured 47.5 cm x 39.5 cm (18.7 in x 15.6 in), but the left hand panel has been cut down.

Yet, by 1890, the symbolism in his work began to ring true with the artistic mood of the day, especially in central Europe. However, despite a renewed interest and an acknowledgment of his originality, his lack of regard for \"painterly effect\" and thinly rendered surfaces jarred with the theories of the time.\nDuring the 1930s, Friedrich's work was used in the promotion of Nazi ideology, which attempted to fit the Romantic artist within the nationalistic Blut und Boden. It took decades for Friedrich's reputation to recover from this association with Nazism. His reliance on symbolism and the fact that his work fell outside the narrow definitions of modernism contributed to his fall from favour. In 1949, art historian Kenneth Clark wrote that Friedrich \"worked in the frigid technique of his time, which could hardly inspire a school of modern painting\", and suggested that the artist was trying to express in painting what is best left to poetry. Clark's dismissal of Friedrich reflected the damage the artist's reputation sustained during the late 1930s.Friedrich's reputation suffered further damage when his imagery was adopted by a number of Hollywood directors, such as Walt Disney, built on the work of such German cinema masters as Fritz Lang and F. W. Murnau, within the horror and fantasy genres. His rehabilitation was slow, but enhanced through the writings of such critics and scholars as Werner Hofmann, Helmut B\u00f6rsch-Supan and Sigrid Hinz, who successfully rejected and rebutted the political associations ascribed to his work, and placed it within a purely art-historical context. By the 1970s, he was again being exhibited in major galleries across the world, as he found favour with a new generation of critics and art historians.\nToday, his international reputation is well established. He is a national icon in his native Germany, and highly regarded by art historians and art connoisseurs across the Western World. He is generally viewed as a figure of great psychological complexity, and according to Vaughan, \"a believer who struggled with doubt, a celebrator of beauty haunted by darkness. In the end, he transcends interpretation, reaching across cultures through the compelling appeal of his imagery.

It had potential for success as it was equipped with several large, well-armed ships: Sv\u00e4rdet (\"the sword\") of 1,800 tonnes, \u00c4pplet (\"the orb\") and Nyckeln (\"the key\"), both 1,400 tonnes, and the enormous Kronan (\"the crown\"). Altogether there were 28 large and medium warships and almost the same number of smaller vessels. The supply organization was lacking. There were few experienced high-ranking officers and internal cooperation was poor; Danish contemporaries scornfully described the Swedish Navy crews as mere \"farmhands dipped in saltwater\".With Kronan as its flagship, the fleet went to sea in October 1675 under Admiral of the Realm (riksamiral) Gustaf Otto Stenbock, but got no farther than Stora Karls\u00f6 off Gotland. The weather was unusually cold and stormy and the ships could not be heated. The crew were poorly clothed and soon many of them fell ill. Supplies dwindled, and after Kronan lost a bow anchor after less than two weeks at sea, Stenbock decided to turn back to the Dalar\u00f6 anchorage north of Stockholm. Nothing came of the reinforcements of the North German provinces. King Charles reacted with anger and held Stenbock personally responsible for the failed expedition, forcing him to pay more than 100,000 dalers out of his own pocket. King Charles later rehabilitated Stenbock by giving him an army appointment in Norway, but in early 1676 he replaced him with Lorentz Creutz, a prominent treasury official.

In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \"He likes you a lot.\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \"lost weekend\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends.  By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed.

Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Ma\u00fdr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \"dangerous modernist\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work\u2014Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed\u2014Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia.\nAt this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Um\u011bleck\u00e1 Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper N\u00e1rodn\u00ed listy. Meanwhile, Bettina had given birth to another daughter, Bo\u017eena.On 23 April 1864, Smetana conducted Berlioz's choral symphony Rom\u00e9o et Juliette at a concert celebrating the Shakespeare tercentenary, adding to the programme his own March for the Shakespearean Festival. That year, Smetana's bid to become Director of the Prague Conservatory failed. He had set high hopes on this appointment: \"My friends are trying to persuade me that this post might have been especially created for me,\" he wrote to a Swedish friend. Again his hopes were thwarted by his association with the perceived radical Liszt, and the appointing committee chose the conservative patriot Josef Krej\u010d\u00ed for the post.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed%C5%99ich_Smetana", "title": "Bed\u0159ich Smetana", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What society did the man who had poor command of the Czech language become chorus master of after returning from Sweden?", "query_id": "14717b22c0a6c044f742a884b1d3f1dfdc70ae2c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Hlahol Choral Society"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Hlahol Choral Society", "answer_start": 1564}]}, {"question": "What was the man who was considered a \"dangerous modernist\" elected president of in March 1863?", "query_id": "2f3aa59f59d454c99c1825410933b6fed8e619a0", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Um\u011bleck\u00e1 Beseda"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Um\u011bleck\u00e1 Beseda", "answer_start": 1872}]}, {"question": "What choral symphony did the man that submitted the score \"The Brandenburgers in Bohemia\" perform in April 1864?", "query_id": "929594f28f235f60bb44cb581690f65ea87c3a10", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Rom\u00e9o et Juliette"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Rom\u00e9o et Juliette", "answer_start": 2182}]}, {"question": "What position did the man who studied Czech grammar fail to attain in 1864?", "query_id": "fad2020be275c29dfe46aa2997277596d145b12b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Director of the Prague Conservatory"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Director of the Prague Conservatory", "answer_start": 2360}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who wrote the choral symphony performed on 23 April 1864 by the man who was president of Um\u011bleck\u00e1 Beseda?", "query_id": "285882175ab735c6e16a2c73233505a473bf5db8", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Berlioz"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Berlioz", "answer_start": 2156}]}]}, "2873c2dd5fbb9fe209981b739e988dfa3702656f": {"passage": "In reviewing the New York premiere, the critics greeted Gianni Schicchi warmly; most reviewers found it to be the best of the three operas. New York Herald Tribune critic Henry Krehbiel described it as \"so uproariously funny ... so full of life, humor, and ingenious devices\". The New York Times reviewer James Huneker considered the opera to be \"a rollicking, madcap scherzo, overflowing with merry deviltries ... And the last shall be first.\" Huneker praised De Luca as \"a most engaging rascal, fit for a minor niche in Moliere's gallery\". The Times critic was also amused by Marto Malatesta as \"The 'Kid' Gherardino, who is spanked by the irate family\".Rome's critics gave Il trittico as a whole a warmer reception, but still saw Gianni Schicchi as the best of the three. Alberto Gasco in La tribuna noted, \"In terms of harmonic technique, Il tabarro and Schicchi advance quite startling elements of novelty. Nothing that contemporary art has produced escapes the studious and astute Giacomo Puccini.\" Gasco also stated that while many critics were waiting for the first two operas with their fists drawn, Gianni Schicchi disarmed these \"hired assassins\" with a \"single glance\". An anonymous reviewer in L'idea nazionale felt that the three works comprised a unified whole, but feared that Puccini was becoming less inventive. L'idea nazionale was a nationalist newspaper, and praised Puccini for returning to an Italian subject \"after so many useless Japanese, American, Parisian digressions\".Modern productions, including those in an updated context, have been generally well received. Describing the 2004 Glyndebourne pairing with The Miserly Knight as \"flip sides of the same coin\", reviewer Edward Seckerson in The Independent found the Schicchi performance \"a triumph of ensemble directing and playing, ... wickedly observed, sharp, focussed and funny\". The New York Times gave a positive review to the Woody Allen 2008 production, which is set in a crowded tenement in which the boy Gherardino is practising knife thrusts. However, the critic questioned Allen's altered ending, in which Schicchi is stabbed by Zita as he addresses the audience. Los Angeles Times critic Mark Swed deemed Allen's production one of the top ten moments in classical music for 2008, and applauded it for \"hilarious wit and engaging musicality\". Allen Rich of Variety praised the piece, though he disliked Allen's idea of beginning the opera with a montage of old film clips, with credits featuring mock-Italian names.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Schicchi", "title": "Gianni Schicchi", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the work Krehbiel describes as \"uproariously funny\"?", "query_id": "6141aabde2f9b292bacea1f7afc8752a81a9e160", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Gianni Schicchi"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Gianni Schicchi", "answer_start": 56}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the opera Huneker considered to be \"a rollicking, madcap scherzo, overflowing with merry deviltries\"?", "query_id": "0f30e541fa14903b53d3ce19bb7988d9a778a2c0", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Gianni Schicchi"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Gianni Schicchi", "answer_start": 56}]}, {"question": "What are the specific names of the first two operas for which, according to Gasco, many critics were waiting with their fists drawn?", "query_id": "72234cb0eb92a974aa166e0d3a9d26e35b5dd9c9", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Schicchi", "Il tabarro"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Schicchi", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "Il tabarro", "answer_start": 843}]}, {"question": "What are the specific names of the three individual works by Puccini that, according to an anonymous reviewer in L'idea nazionale, comprised a unified whole?", "query_id": "1a668dd9357de7e3ff1eca80b8f8d1137623cc7b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Il tabarro", "Schicchi", "Gianni Schicchi"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Il tabarro", "answer_start": 843}, {"text": "Schicchi", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "Gianni Schicchi", "answer_start": 733}]}]}, "e4b5c3cb8b911cb6941222130dc46f6f81eddda3": {"passage": "By the end of the 1960s, Ornette Coleman had become one of the most influential musicians in jazz after pioneering its most controversial subgenre, free jazz, which jazz critics and musicians initially derided for its deviation from conventional structures of harmony and tonality. In the mid-1970s, he stopped recording free jazz, recruited electric instrumentalists, and pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics. According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key, and still sound coherent as a group. He taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach, based on their individual tendencies, and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles. Coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of \"collective consciousness\" that stresses \"human feelings\" and \"biological rhythms\", and said that he wanted the music, rather than himself, to be successful. He also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music, including rock influences such as the electric guitar and non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians.Of Human Feelings was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing. Coleman found Tacuma's playing ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to change. Although Coleman's theory initially challenged his knowledge and perception of music, Tacuma came to like the unconventional role each band member was given as a soloist and melodist: \"When we read Ornette's music we have his notes, but we listen for his phrases and phrase the way he wants to. I can take the same melody, then, and phrase it like I want to, and those notes will determine the phrasing, the rhythm, the harmony \u2013 all of that.\"", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Of_Human_Feelings", "title": "Of Human Feelings", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the last name of the person who stopped recording free jazz in the mid-1970s?", "query_id": "34a95e05e06175a9e13076fc25ce01bdd8b62dbd", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Coleman"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Coleman", "answer_start": 740}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who recruited electric instrumentalists in the mid '70s?", "query_id": "21c2b48121ea8f22691286f46b239d13993c0a83", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Coleman"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Coleman", "answer_start": 740}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics in the mid '70s?", "query_id": "b503f23f0eaa69da74852b63e2bc7bca3eca0209", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Coleman"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Coleman", "answer_start": 740}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who taught his sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach?", "query_id": "07e466d7b8d434f89ef58d29949f84c83104f180", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Coleman"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Coleman", "answer_start": 740}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who prevented his sidemen from being influenced by conventional styles?", "query_id": "b83300e708481dd6436540a85125fe2051634176", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Coleman"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Coleman", "answer_start": 740}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who wanted his music, rather than himself, to be successful?", "query_id": "793106c06aff95a1d20e02ede09e844f6dadee05", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Coleman"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Coleman", "answer_start": 740}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music?", "query_id": "f3ad72421196ad5182e924115b44b57ccac778b9", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Coleman"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Coleman", "answer_start": 740}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who started to incorporate the electric guitar into his music?", "query_id": "16dceafcc21b7b317b9394c01422895cc4a2494d", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Coleman"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Coleman", "answer_start": 740}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who started to incorporate non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians into his music?

While it is a literal reflection of the king and queen, Snyder writes \"it is the image of exemplary monarchs, a reflection of ideal character\"  Later he focuses his attention on the princess, writing that Vel\u00e1zquez's portrait is \"the painted equivalent of a manual for the education of the princess\u2014a mirror of the princess\". The painting is likely to have been influenced by Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, of 1434. At the time, van Eyck's painting hung in Philip's palace, and would have been familiar to Vel\u00e1zquez. The Arnolfini Portrait also has a mirror positioned at the back of the pictorial space, reflecting two figures who would have the same angle of vision as does the viewer of Vel\u00e1zquez's painting; they are too small to identify, but it has been speculated that one may be intended as the artist himself, though he is not shown in the act of painting. According to Lucien D\u00e4llenbach:\nThe mirror [in Las Meninas] faces the observer as in Van Eyck's painting. But here the procedure is more realistic to the degree that the \"rearview\" mirror in which the royal couple appears is no longer convex but flat. Whereas the reflection in the Flemish painting recomposed objects and characters within a space that is condensed and deformed by the curve of the mirror, that of Vel\u00e1zquez refuses to play with the laws of perspective: it projects onto the canvas the perfect double of the king and queen positioned in front of the painting. Moreover, in showing the figures whom the painter observes, and also, through the mediation of the mirror, the figures who are observing him, the painter achieves a reciprocity of gazes that makes the interior oscillate with the exterior and which causes the image to \"emerge from its frame\" at the same time that it invites the visitors to enter the painting.\nJonathan Miller asks: \"What are we to make of the blurred features of the royal couple? It is unlikely that it has anything to do with the optical imperfection of the mirror, which would, in reality, have displayed a focused image of the King and Queen\".

Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45\u201370 cm (18\u201328 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes.\nGregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartebeest", "title": "Hartebeest 0", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What are the two names of the African antelope?", "query_id": "2bf37b64210e39b7848388837aacfe31dc9ba856", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["hartebeest", "kongoni"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "hartebeest", "answer_start": 4}, {"text": "kongoni", "answer_start": 56}]}, {"question": "What is the common English name of the animal that has eight subspecies?", "query_id": "67c7b49e6279a70193d5362db81c33c7b52c5a5d", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["African antelope"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "African antelope", "answer_start": 71}]}, {"question": "What is the scientific name of the animal that has eight subspecies?

Supai Group was deposited in late Mississippian, through the Pennsylvanian and into the early Permian time, some 320 million to 270 million years ago. Both marine and non-marine deposits of mud, silt, sand and calcareous sediments were laid down on a broad coastal plain similar to the Texas Gulf Coast of today.  Around this time, the Ancestral Rocky Mountains rose in Colorado and New Mexico and streams brought eroded sediment from them to the Grand Canyon area.Supai Group formations in the western part of the canyon contain limestone, indicative of a warm, shallow sea, while the eastern part was probably a muddy river delta.  This formation consists of red siltstones and shale capped by tan-colored sandstone beds that together reach a thickness of 600 to 700 ft (around 200 m). Shale in the early Permian formations in this group were oxidized to a bright red color.  Fossils of amphibian footprints, reptiles, and plentiful plant material are found in the eastern part and increasing numbers of marine fossils are found in the western part.Formations of the Supai Group are from oldest to youngest (an unconformity is present at the top of each): Watahomigi (see 5a in figure 1) is a slope-forming gray limestone with some red chert bands, sandstone, and purple siltstone that is 100 to 300 feet (30 to 90 m) thick.

In retrospective review of records, both British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt were increasingly torn between their commitments to their Polish ally and the demands by Stalin and his diplomats.According to the Polish diplomat Edward Bernard Raczy\u0144ski, Raczy\u0144ski and General Sikorski met privately with Churchill and Alexander Cadogan on 15 April 1943, and told them the Poles had proof the Soviets were responsible for the massacre. Raczy\u0144ski reports Churchill, \"without committing himself, showed by his manner that he had no doubt of it\". Churchill said \"The Bolsheviks can be very cruel\". However, at the same time, on 24 April 1943, Churchill assured the Soviets: \"We shall certainly oppose vigorously any 'investigation' by the International Red Cross or any other body in any territory under German authority. Such investigation would be a fraud and its conclusions reached by terrorism\". Unofficial or classified UK documents concluded Soviet guilt was a \"near certainty\", but the alliance with the Soviets was deemed to be more important than moral issues; thus the official version supported the Soviets, up to censoring any contradictory accounts. Churchill asked Owen O'Malley to investigate the issue, but in a note to the Foreign Secretary he noted: \"All this is merely to ascertain the facts, because we should none of us ever speak a word about it.\" O'Malley pointed out several inconsistencies and near impossibilities in the Soviet version. Later, Churchill sent a copy of the report to Roosevelt on 13 August 1943. The report deconstructed the Soviet account of the massacre and alluded to the political consequences within a strongly moral framework but recognized there was no viable alternative to the existing policy. No comment by Roosevelt on the O'Malley report has been found. Churchill's own post-war account of the Katyn affair gives little further insight.

Of his work as a whole, Byron Adams in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians writes:\nWalton's music has often been too neatly dismissed by a few descriptive tags: \"bittersweet\", \"nostalgic\" and, after World War II, \"same as before\". Such convenient categorizations ignore the expressive variety of his music and slight his determination to deepen his technical and expressive resources as he grew older. His early discovery of the basic elements of his style allowed him to assimilate successfully an astonishing number of disparate and apparently contradictory influences, such as Anglican anthems, jazz, and the music of Stravinsky, Sibelius, Ravel and Elgar.\nThe writer adds that Walton's allegiance to his basic style never wavered and that this loyalty to his own vision, together with his rhythmic vitality, sensuous melancholy, sly charm and orchestral flair, gives Walton's finest music \"an imperishable glamour\". Another biographer of Walton, Neil Tierney, writes that although contemporary critics felt that the post-war music did not match Walton's pre-war compositions, it has become clear that the later works are \"if emotionally less direct, more profound.\"", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Walton", "title": "William Walton", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the person that was influenced by Ravel?", "query_id": "492c576088ad6092b3c8ebed0942f1d845591d70", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Walton"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Walton", "answer_start": 0}]}]}, "5dcadd48dd86afec5fd89bb933e0b503044aad65": {"passage": "Boise National Forest was created on July 1, 1908, from part of Sawtooth National Forest, and originally covered 1,147,360 acres (4,643.2 km2). By the Forest Reserve Act of 1891, the U.S. Congress granted the U.S. President the authority to establish forest reserves out of Public Domain Lands that were subject to disposal (homesteads, sales, etc.) administered by the General Land Office, which had been placed under the authority of the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1849. With the passage of the Transfer Act of 1905, forest reserves were transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the newly created U.S. Forest Service. Present-day Boise National Forest was first protected as part of two forest reserves by proclamations issued by President Theodore Roosevelt: Sawtooth Forest Reserve (created on May 29, 1905, and expanded on November 6, 1906) and Payette Forest Reserve (created on June 3, 1905). After forest reserves were renamed national forests in 1908, Boise National Forest was split from Sawtooth National Forest into an independent national forest. On April 1, 1944, the entirety of what was then Payette National Forest was transferred to Boise National Forest, and simultaneously Weiser and Idaho national forests were combined to reestablish the present-day Payette National Forest, which is to the north of Boise National Forest. In 1933 the Boise Basin Experimental Forest was created on 8,740 acres (35.4 km2) of the forest near Idaho City to study the management of ponderosa pine. The Lucky Peak Nursery was established in 1959 to produce trees for planting on burned or logged lands on the national forests of the Intermountain region.After the creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1933, nine camps and eight subcamps were set up in Boise National Forest, but the number of camps was reduced from 1934 until the program was closed in 1942. Work conducted by the CCC included fire suppression, fish habitat improvement, and construction of guard houses, fire lookouts, campgrounds, roads, and trails, among other facilities.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise_National_Forest", "title": "Boise National Forest 2", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "After the name of forest reserves were changed, what were two national forests were combined into?", "query_id": "b1f70f43495e45450b8e0302c4ed671c4d3776cf", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Payette National Forest"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Payette National Forest", "answer_start": 1292}]}, {"question": "What year was the organization that works on fire lookouts, campgrounds, and roads established?", "query_id": "40a5169aa2c6570c33091d480b10452d61f74532", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["1933"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "1933", "answer_start": 1738}]}]}, "2048d98289e3f561ecccdb9f8284b4e5d9aaa01e": {"passage": "Time-Life also wanted to expand, as its existing space in 1 Rockefeller Plaza had become insufficient by 1953. In August of that year, Rockefeller Center Inc. bought a tract of land on the west side of Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st streets. Rockefeller Center's managers originally wanted to build an extra NBC studio or a Ford vehicle showroom on the site. However, they changed their minds once they saw Time Inc.'s expansion needs: the company wanted to have its headquarters in a single building. As they would outgrow their existing space in 1 Rockefeller Plaza by 1954, the company would have to move elsewhere. Not wanting to lose Time Inc.'s tenancy, the complex's managers hired Harrison & Abramovitz, composed of Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz, to create plans for a building on the newly acquired plot that could house both NBC and Time. NBC later dropped out of the deal because its CEO, David Sarnoff, dissented.In 1956, two years after the demolition of the Center Theatre, officials announced the construction of a new tower, the Time-Life Building, on the western side of Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets. The 500-foot (150 m), $7 million building ($97.2 in 2018 dollars) would include connections to the existing passageway system and to the Roxy Theater directly to its west. The tower would rise as a 48-story slab, with a plaza to the east and an eight-story annex along its western and northern sides. One of Rockefeller Center's subsidiaries, Westprop Inc., bought the air rights to the original Roxy Theater located next door so that the new tower could conform to the Zoning Resolution of 1916. Time Inc. and Rockefeller Center formed a joint venture, Rock-Time Inc., which would share the tower's rent income between them. Construction on the Time-Life Building's steelwork started in April 1958, and the structure topped out in November of that year. The cornerstone of the building was laid in June 1959, after the building's structure had been completed, and the first tenants began moving into the tower in December 1959.During this time, plans called for Rockefeller Center to expand northward. Rockefeller Center, Uris Buildings Corporation, and Webb and Knapp formed another joint venture, Rock-Uris Corp., to construct a hotel to the west of 75 Rockefeller Center. However, Webb and Knapp faced monetary shortages, and the joint venture found that a hotel was not the most profitable use of the land. The joint venture instead decided to construct a glass-and-concrete 43-story office building on the site, with connections to the complex's underground concourse. In 1961, the building was named after Sperry Corporation, which leased eight floors in the future building. The planned hotel was moved to another site two blocks north, on the west side of Sixth Avenue between 53rd Streets. This became the New York Hilton at Rockefeller Center, which opened in 1963. The hotel's name was misleading because it was located outside the complex and not connected to the underground mall. The mall could not be extended anyway because the 53rd Street subway was in the way. Further expansion of Rockefeller Center on the west side of Sixth Avenue, between the Hilton and the new Time-Life Building, was not possible because the Equitable Life Assurance Society had built a tower in between the two properties.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_of_Rockefeller_Center", "title": "Construction of Rockefeller Center", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What building had the Roxy Theater directly to its west?", "query_id": "55a0c8c7c50978fe421418d3286e0446a53ca0ba", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["the Time-Life Building"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "the Time-Life Building", "answer_start": 1051}]}, {"question": "What building's cornerstone was laid in June 1959?", "query_id": "edc5c84da52bae8a972f845870b46c762ec4f46c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["the Time-Life Building"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "the Time-Life Building", "answer_start": 1051}]}]}, "44136c4d0d622138963dd955d51365220c7dbd41": {"passage": "Jeannette's departure from San Francisco, on July 8, 1879, was a popular spectacle, witnessed by large crowds who came from all quarters of the city. The army at Fort Point provided an eleven-gun salute; in contrast, De Long noted that none of the naval vessels in and around San Francisco made any formal acknowledgement of their sister-ship's departure, \"[not even] the blast of a steam whistle\". Bennett,  absent in Europe, cabled that he hoped to be present when Jeannette made its triumphant return.The first weeks on the journey northwards were uneventful.  On August 3, Jeannette reached Unalaska in the Aleutian Islands, where De Long sought information on Nordenski\u00f6ld from the crew of a revenue cutter, newly returned  from the Bering Strait. The cutter had no news of him. On August 12, Jeannette reached St. Michael, a small port on the Alaskan mainland, and waited for the Francis Hyde to arrive with extra provisions and coal.At St Michael, De Long hired two experienced Inuit dog drivers, and took on board a number of sled dogs.  On August 21, after transferring provisions and fuel, Francis Hyde departed; Jeannette set out for the Chukchi Peninsula on the Siberian coast, to enquire after Nordenski\u00f6ld. At Saint Lawrence Bay the Chukchi people reported that an unidentified steamer had recently passed by, going south. De Long then headed through the Bering Strait towards Cape Dezhnev, where he learned from locals that a ship had called at Cape Serdtse-Kamen, further along the coast. Here, a shore party from Jeannette quickly established  from artifacts left behind with villagers that this ship was Vega and that Nordenski\u00f6ld's expedition had therefore safely completed the Northeast passage.

In November 2009, 800 pairs of Goldstein's sneakers were listed on eBay to raise funds for the organization. In August 2010, the fund made a donation to the Los Angeles' Phoenix House Academy to help rehab patients develop musical talents. Goldstein's sister Lara, who founded the fund, died from cancer in May 2011. In August 2011, several DJs paid tribute to Goldstein at the Vanity Nightclub in the Las Vegas Hard Rock Casino, helping raise money for the fund. In May 2012, the eighth annual MusiCares benefit concert featured a special presentation commemorating the launch of the DJ AM Memorial Fund. Goldstein's mother, in conjunction with the fund, was reported to be assisting MusiCares in providing recovery services to addicts. Moby deejayed at the event in tribute to Goldstein.Goldstein posthumously won DJ of the Year at the 2009 BET Hip Hop Awards. In October 2009 he was depicted in the South Park episode \"Dead Celebrities\", along with other celebrities who died in mid-2009. Eminem, who nearly died from a methadone overdose in late 2007, paid tribute to Goldstein on the 2010 song \"Talkin' 2 Myself\", rapping: \"Rest in peace to DJ AM/'cause I know what it's like/I struggle with this shit every single day.\" On the cover of the 2011 Blink-182 album, Neighborhoods, \"DJ AM\" can be seen written on one of the buildings, as a memorial.

Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.During Watts's lifetime, European culture had begun to question the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.\nIn late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that \"I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them.\" Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter Evelyn De Morgan, drew on the imagery of Psalm 137 and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors. Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.Watts generally worked on his allegorical paintings on and off over an extended period, but it appears that Hope was completed relatively quickly. He left no notes regarding his creation of the work, but his close friend Emilie Barrington noted that \"a beautiful friend of mine\", almost certainly Dorothy Dene, modelled for Hope in 1885. (Dorothy Dene, n\u00e9e Ada Alice Pullen, was better known as a model for Frederic Leighton but is known to have also modelled for Watts in this period. Although the facial features of Hope are obscured in Watts's painting, her distinctive jawline and hair are both recognisable.)

The Anthony Roll belongs to a genre of works that was intended to serve a dual role for the king and the military leadership: as reasonably informative overviews listing details of ships or strategic areas of coastlines they could be studied to determine strengths and weaknesses, and as boastful and lively depictions of Tudor military might they could be used to flatter the king, impress courtiers and impose martial authority on foreign ambassadors. Contemporary maps, or \"plats\", were routinely decorated with detailed pictures of ships, to mark bodies of water as much as to liven up the scenes. Such maps were common at the time, and were even embellished by artists if deemed too simple or drab. The navy was expanded during Henry VIII's reign, and he was known to take an interest in warships, as can be seen by the epic painting Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover which portrayed, if rather unrealistically, the ships that took the 29-year-old king to the summit meeting with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. This painting, recently dated to around 1545, has also been suggested as a likely source of inspiration to Anthony for his illustrations.There are three such plats depicting naval actions and expeditions that are attributed to Anthony: the route of Anne of Cleves from the Low Countries to England (1539), a French attack on a coastal fort (date unknown) and a French raid on Brighton (July 1545). The design of the ships in these paintings, especially that of the Brighton raid, closely match those in the rolls. It is not known exactly when work on the rolls began nor when it was finished. It is only certain that it was presented to the king the year it was dated, 1546. The inclusion of the Mary Rose that sank at the Battle of the Solent 19 July 1545 does not mean it was necessarily started before this date, since it was still considered possible that she could be raised even as late as 1549. The galleasses, the Antelope, Hart, Bull and Tiger, all present in the second roll, were still being built around March 1546, and the Hart was not at sea until October that year.

By combining '70s style hard rock riffing with alternative rock, Audioslave created a distinctive sound. This mix was driven by Cornell's wide vocal range, Morello's innovative guitar solos and the robust rhythm section of Wilk and Commerford. Morello, although stating he \"never felt musically limited\" in Rage Against the Machine, did say that he had \"a lot more scope to explore with Audioslave\" and a \"wider musical territory.\" This meant that the instrumentalists had the opportunity to write slow and melodic songs, something they had not done before.\nAs opposed to de la Rocha's lyrics, Cornell's were mostly apolitical; Morello referred to them as \"haunted, existential poetry.\" They were characterised by his cryptic approach, often dealing with themes of existentialism, love, hedonism, spirituality and Christianity. Audioslave's first two albums drew influences from 1970s hard rock and heavy metal such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath and from the members' previous bands (the grunge sound of Soundgarden and the funk metal sound of Rage Against the Machine). For Revelations, which was influenced by 1960s and '70s funk, soul and R&B music, Morello used vintage guitars and amplifiers and Cornell adopted his \"seventies funk and R&B-flavor vocals.\" The guitarist also cited Sly & the Family Stone, James Brown and Funkadelic as a reason for the funk overtones on the album.Just as Rage Against the Machine did, Audioslave also included the statement \"All sounds made by guitar, bass, drums and vocals\" in their albums' booklets as Morello's guitar work often caused listeners to believe that the band used samples, synthesiser effects or different turntable techniques to produce certain sounds.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audioslave", "title": "Audioslave", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Whose cryptic approach characterized the lyrics that often dealt with themes of existentialism, love, hedonism, spirituality and Christianity?", "query_id": "a6321ee2898dd27bd89a0c1a104c6449fca7b458", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Cornell"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Cornell", "answer_start": 717}]}, {"question": "What are the individual names of the member's previous bands from which Audioslave's first two albums drew influences?", "query_id": "ca1a71d9515230b641bf67ee3e1371e0bcf957f8", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Soundgarden", "Rage Against the Machine"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Soundgarden", "answer_start": 1131}, {"text": "Rage Against the Machine", "answer_start": 1171}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the album for which Morella cites Sly & the Family Stone, James Brown and Funkadelic as a reason for the funk overtones?

In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole.  Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86\u00b013.6\u2032N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean.\nThe idea for the expedition had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that a specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole.\nNansen supervised the construction of a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work. Fram's drift and Nansen's sledge journey proved conclusively that there were no significant land masses between the Eurasian continents and the North Pole, and confirmed the general character of the north polar region as a deep, ice-covered sea. Although Nansen retired from exploration after this expedition, the methods of travel and survival he developed with Johansen influenced all the polar expeditions, north and south, which followed in the subsequent three decades.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nansen%27s_Fram_expedition", "title": "Nansen's Fram expedition", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the full name of the person whose ship was frozen into the pack ice while waiting for the drift to carry her towards the North Pole?", "query_id": "9673422d8472aa86aad03070162b29e1aae0e1cc", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Fridtjof Nansen"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Fridtjof Nansen", "answer_start": 77}]}, {"question": "What are the full names of the two individuals who did not ultimately reach the North Pole?", "query_id": "10ede9b33fd791b4bc220045ace8c2c29684dd36", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Fridtjof Nansen", "Hjalmar Johansen"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Fridtjof Nansen", "answer_start": 77}, {"text": "Hjalmar Johansen", "answer_start": 540}]}, {"question": "What is the precise geographic name of the pole Nansen and Johansen left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges to make for?", "query_id": "4528f41edc763aba9d7e645d63cb33eaedaad900", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["North Pole"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "North Pole", "answer_start": 119}]}, {"question": "What are the full names of the two individuals who achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86\u00b013.6\u2032N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land?", "query_id": "232f43709efb823fd768ff0e9f963fd5b8f117a1", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Fridtjof Nansen", "Hjalmar Johansen"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Fridtjof Nansen", "answer_start": 77}, {"text": "Hjalmar Johansen", "answer_start": 540}]}]}, "448a9517e785f1a90ea8fe1da2ecf91339157728": {"passage": "The changing world order that the war had brought about, in particular the growth of the United States and Japan as naval powers, and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland, caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy. Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan, Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States. This decision was the source of much debate in Britain during the 1930s as militaristic governments took hold in Germany and Japan helped in part by the Great Depression, for it was feared that the empire could not survive a simultaneous attack by both nations. The issue of the empire's security was a serious concern in Britain, as it was vital to the British economy.In 1919, the frustrations caused by delays to Irish home rule led the MPs of Sinn F\u00e9in, a pro-independence party that had won a majority of the Irish seats in the 1918 British general election, to establish an independent parliament in Dublin, at which Irish independence was declared. The Irish Republican Army simultaneously began a guerrilla war against the British administration. The Anglo-Irish War ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, creating the Irish Free State, a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown.

The piece, which refers to the nymphs in Greek mythology who inhabited the Mediterranean Sea, premiered on 4 June 1914 at the Norfolk Music Festival in Connecticut with Sibelius conducting. Praised upon its premiere as \"the finest evocation of the sea ... ever ... produced in music\", the tone poem, in D major, consists of two subjects, said to represent the playful activity of the nymphs and the majesty of the ocean, respectively. Sibelius gradually develops this material over three informal stages: first, a placid ocean; second, a gathering storm; and third, a thunderous wave-crash climax. As the tempest subsides, a final chord sounds, symbolizing the mighty power and limitless expanse of the sea.\nStylistically, many commentators have described The Oceanides as either an outright example of Impressionism or somehow derivative of that art movement. Others have countered that Sibelius's active development of the two subjects, his sparing use of scales favored by Impressionists, and his prioritization of action and structure over ephemeral, atmospheric background distinguish the piece from quintessential examples, such as Debussy's La mer.\nAside from the definitive D major tone poem, two intermediate versions of The Oceanides survive: the first, a three-movement orchestral suite, in E\u266d major, that dates to 1913 (movement No. 1 lost); and the second, the initial single-movement \"Yale\" version of the tone poem, in D\u266d major, which Sibelius dispatched to America in advance of his journey but revised prior to the music festival. The Oceanides thus stands alongside En saga, the Lemmink\u00e4inen Suite, the Violin Concerto, and the Fifth Symphony as one of Sibelius's most overhauled works. The suite and Yale version, never performed in the composer's lifetime, received their world premieres by Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4 and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra on 10 September and 24 October 2002, respectively.

He  was soon performing around 120 concerts a year, generally to great critical acclaim, and in  April 1921 reached a wider audience by performing in a cinema, New York's Capitol Theatre. Grainger  commented that the huge audiences at these cinema concerts often showed greater appreciation for his playing than those at established concert venues such as Carnegie Hall and the Aeolian. In the summer of 1919 he led a course in piano technique at Chicago Musical College, the first of many such educational duties he would undertake in later years.Amid his concert and teaching duties, Grainger found time to re-score many of his works (a habit he continued throughout his life) and also to compose new pieces: his Children's March: Over the Hills and Far Away, and the orchestral version of The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart both originated in this period.   He also began to develop the technique of elastic scoring, a form of flexible orchestration  which enabled works to be  performed by different numbers of players and instrument types, from small chamber groups  up to full orchestral strength.In April 1921 Grainger moved with his mother to a large house in White Plains, New York. This was  his  home for the remainder of his life. From the beginning of 1922 Rose's health deteriorated sharply; she was suffering from  delusions and nightmares, and became  fearful that her illness would harm her son's career. Because of the closeness of the bond between the two, there had long been  rumours that  their relationship was incestuous;  in April 1922 Rose was directly challenged over this issue by her friend Lotta Hough. From her last letter to Grainger, dated 29 April, it seems that this confrontation unbalanced Rose; on 30 April, while Grainger was touring on the West Coast, she jumped to her death from an office window  on the 18th floor of the Aeolian Building in New York City. The letter, which began \"I am out of my mind and cannot think properly\", asked Grainger if he had ever spoken to Lotta of \"improper love\".

The music was first used in the Hymn of the Bolshevik Party, created in 1939. When the Comintern was dissolved in 1943, the government argued that \"The Internationale\", which was historically associated with the Comintern, should be replaced as the National Anthem of the Soviet Union. Alexandrov's music was chosen as the new anthem by the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin after a contest in 1943. Stalin praised the song for fulfilling what a national anthem should be, though he criticized the song's orchestration.In response, Alexandrov blamed the problems on Viktor Knushevitsky, who was responsible for orchestrating the entries for the final contest rounds. When writing the Bolshevik party anthem, Alexandrov incorporated pieces from the song \"Life Has Become Better\" (Russian: \u0416\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0301\u043b\u043e \u041b\u0443\u0301\u0447\u0448\u0435, tr. Zhit Stalo Luchshe), a musical comedy that he composed. This comedy was based on a slogan Stalin first used in 1935. Over 200 entries were submitted for the anthem contest, including some by famous Soviet composers Dmitri Shostakovich, Aram Khachaturian and Iona Tuskiya. Later, the rejected joint entry by Khachaturian and Shostakovich became Song of the Red Army, and Khachaturian went on to compose the Anthem of the Armenian SSR. There was also an entry from Boris Alexandrov, the son of Alexander. His rejected entry, \"Long Live Our State\" (Russian: \u0414\u0430 \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430, tr. Da zdravstvuyet nasha derzhava), became a popular patriotic song and was adopted as the anthem of Transnistria.During the 2000 debate on the anthem, Boris Gryzlov, the leader of the Unity faction in the Duma, noted that the music which Alexandrov wrote for the Soviet anthem was similar to Vasily Kalinnikov's 1892 overture, \"Bylina\".  Supporters of the Soviet anthem mentioned this in the various debates held in the Duma on the change of anthem, but there is no evidence that Alexandrov consciously used parts of \"Bylina\" in his composition.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem_of_Russia", "title": "National anthem of Russia", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the first name of the person who praised the song for fulfilling what a national anthem should be?", "query_id": "70cc325ac0d8e48243693e6b53914bb65ce57c3a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Joseph"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Joseph", "answer_start": 490}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who criticized the song's orchestration?", "query_id": "57150d912f39fdede4e035ec209d21c69ec73738", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Joseph"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Joseph", "answer_start": 490}]}, {"question": "What was the first name of the person who blamed the problems on Viktor Knushevitsky, who was responsible for orchestrating the entries for the final contest rounds?", "query_id": "f4faaa46a22e5fb3ab0eabb8161509265e318f0d", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Alexander"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Alexander", "answer_start": 45}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who incorporated pieces from the song \"Life Has Become Better\" when writing the Bolshevik party anthem?", "query_id": "82fa55844eba38c648d4ab363850377365bdbe86", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Alexander"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Alexander", "answer_start": 45}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who entered the song \"Long Live Our State?\"", "query_id": "fe928c360e479249cb2f63ee2560cca1972da0a7", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Boris"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Boris", "answer_start": 1404}]}]}, "e67cc0a4677ee2dce21774c66f367400ecfd342b": {"passage": "A truce between two rival gangs, the Tigers and the JPs, come to an end when after a day at school, the Tigers are attacked by members of the JPs, led by Spider.

The extent to which it is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley describes it as a hybrid work, with elements of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length\u2014about eighty minutes\u2014was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.A London Symphony (1911\u20131913) which the composer later observed might more accurately be called a \"symphony by a Londoner\", is for the most part not overtly pictorial in its presentation of London. Vaughan Williams insisted that it is \"self-expressive, and must stand or fall as 'absolute' music\". There are some references to the urban soundscape: brief impressions of street music, with the sound of the barrel organ mimicked by the orchestra; the characteristic chant of the lavender-seller; the jingle of hansom cabs; and the chimes of Big Ben played by harp and clarinet. But commentators have heard\u2014and the composer never denied or confirmed\u2014some social comment in sinister echoes at the end of the scherzo and an orchestral outburst of pain and despair at the opening of the finale. Schwartz comments that the symphony, in its \"unified presentation of widely heterogeneous elements\", is \"very much like the city itself\". Vaughan Williams said in his later years that this was his favourite of the symphonies.The last of the first group is A Pastoral Symphony (1921). The first three movements are for orchestra alone; a wordless solo soprano or tenor voice is added in the finale. Despite the title the symphony draws little on the folk-songs beloved of the composer, and the pastoral landscape evoked is not a tranquil English scene, but the French countryside ravaged by war. Some English musicians who had not fought in the First World War misunderstood the work and heard only the slow tempi and quiet tone, failing to notice the character of a requiem in the music and mistaking the piece for a rustic idyll. Kennedy comments that it was not until after the Second World War that \"the spectral 'Last Post' in the second movement and the girl's lamenting voice in the finale\" were widely noticed and understood.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Vaughan_Williams", "title": "Ralph Vaughan Williams", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the title of the work within whose thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow?", "query_id": "b95a8c86cd58af89dcdb3f71df60725e14421976", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["A Sea Symphony"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "A Sea Symphony", "answer_start": 181}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the symphony Vaughan Williams said in later years was his favorite?", "query_id": "34cd927b3c66b54ebb7eb44bba1a7262c25efee5", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["A London Symphony"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "A London Symphony", "answer_start": 761}]}, {"question": "What is the title of the symphony that draws little on the folk-songs beloved by the composer?", "query_id": "8350e5c0f86d7a605050e4309a96c567228b7ed2", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["A Pastoral Symphony"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "A Pastoral Symphony", "answer_start": 1807}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the work some English musicians who had not fought in the First World War misunderstood?", "query_id": "31a9690737289b06979cd42adae0eb8771e26b69", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["A Pastoral Symphony"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "A Pastoral Symphony", "answer_start": 1807}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the piece mistaken for a rustic idyll by some English musicians?", "query_id": "b5248b7d3f4454c9d0c59068c6282891740af2d0", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["A Pastoral Symphony"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "A Pastoral Symphony", "answer_start": 1807}]}, {"question": "What are the precise names of the first three symphonies to which Vaughan Williams assigned titles rather than numbers?", "query_id": "602c71fd7965aa872c873b01098dcc39fef990bd", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["A Sea Symphony", "A London Symphony", "A Pastoral Symphony"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "A Sea Symphony", "answer_start": 181}, {"text": "A London Symphony", "answer_start": 761}, {"text": "A Pastoral Symphony", "answer_start": 1807}]}, {"question": "What are the precise titles of the first three symphonies that form a sub-group within the nine?", "query_id": "b2ffd30d063bd80013732a7caae97a485d2aba67", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["A Sea Symphony", "A London Symphony", "A Pastoral Symphony"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "A Sea Symphony", "answer_start": 181}, {"text": "A London Symphony", "answer_start": 761}, {"text": "A Pastoral Symphony", "answer_start": 1807}]}]}, "37cfc064049d2de258e479459513c2d33ea89d84": {"passage": "The story is about a lawsuit concerning injuries caused by a defective automobile.

Classical Palmyra had a distinctive culture, based on a local Semitic tradition, and influenced by Greece and Rome. To appear better integrated into the Roman Empire, some Palmyrenes adopted Greco-Roman names, either alone or in addition to a second native name. The extent of Greek influence on Palmyra's culture is debated. Scholars interpreted the Palmyrenes' Greek practices differently; many see those characters as a superficial layer over a local essence. Palmyra's senate was an example; although Palmyrene texts written in Greek described it as a \"boule\" (a Greek institution), the senate was a gathering of non-elected tribal elders (a Near-Eastern assembly tradition). Others view Palmyra's culture as a fusion of local and Greco-Roman traditions.\nThe culture of Persia influenced Palmyrene military tactics, dress and court ceremonies. Palmyra had no large libraries or publishing facilities, and it lacked an intellectual movement characteristic of other Eastern cities such as Edessa or Antioch. Although Zenobia opened her court to academics, the only notable scholar documented was Cassius Longinus.Palmyra had a large agora. However, unlike the Greek Agoras (public gathering places shared with public buildings), Palmyra's agora resembled an Eastern caravanserai more than a hub of public life. The Palmyrenes buried their dead in elaborate family mausoleums, most with interior walls forming rows of burial chambers (loculi) in which the dead, laying at full length, were placed. A relief of the person interred formed part of the wall's decoration, acting as a headstone. Sarcophagi appeared in the late second century and were used in some of the tombs. Many burial monuments contained mummies embalmed in a method similar to that used in Ancient Egypt.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra", "title": "Palmyra", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What object began to appear in the late second century tombs of the people who inhabited the city most culturally affiliated with Western Syria?", "query_id": "92d67f5ec81a2d97367139d6df82e5af2db0348c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Sarcophagi"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Sarcophagi", "answer_start": 1729}]}, {"question": "What did the agoras of the city that had a culture based on local Semitic tradition, and influenced by Greece and Rome more closely resemble?", "query_id": "f868e4e8bed29468da8118c55ac2bd42a91980dc", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Eastern caravanserai"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Eastern caravanserai", "answer_start": 1397}]}, {"question": "What other culture did the embalming methods used by the city that had citizens who adopted Greco-Roman names resemble?", "query_id": "9c7d03b360f0d043c53d1e5ae8d875c4e5bc3791", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Egypt"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Egypt", "answer_start": 1905}]}]}, "3e8c457e7c398240b3e554a7da8f9f0739821c30": {"passage": "In a 1946 paper, the folklorist John H. Evans recorded the existence of a local folk belief that a battle was fought at the site of the Coldrum Stones, and that a \"Black Prince\" was buried within its chamber. He suggested that the tales of battles taking place at this site and at other Medway Megaliths had not developed independently among the local population but had \"percolated down from the theories of antiquaries\" who believed that the fifth-century Battle of Aylesford, which was recorded in the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, took place in the area.\nEvans also recorded a local folk belief applied to all of the Medway Megaliths and which had been widespread \"up to the last generation\"; this was that it was impossible for anyone to successfully count the number of stones in the monuments. This \"countless stones\" motif is not unique to the Medway region, and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in Britain. The earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early 16th-century document, where it applies to the stone circle of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, although in an early 17th-century document it was applied to The Hurlers, a set of three stone circles in Cornwall. Later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in England, as well as a single occurrence each in Wales and Ireland. The folklorist S. P. Menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an animistic understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own.Several modern Pagan religions are practiced at the Medway Megaliths, with Pagan activity having taken place at the Coldrum Stones from at least the late 1980s. These Pagans commonly associated the sites both with a concept of ancestry and of them being a source of \"earth energy\". The scholar of religion Ethan Doyle White argued that these sites in particular were interpreted as having connections to the ancestors both because they were created by Neolithic peoples whom modern Pagans view as their \"own spiritual ancestors\" and because the sites were once chambered tombs, and thus held the remains of the dead, who themselves may have been perceived as ancestors. On this latter point, Pagan perspectives on these sites are shaped by older archaeological interpretations. The Pagans also cited the Megaliths as spots marking sources of \"earth energy\", often aligned on ley lines, an idea probably derived ultimately from the publications of Earth Mysteries proponents like John Michell.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldrum_Long_Barrow", "title": "Coldrum Long Barrow", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What site of battles taking place was suggested by Evans to not have been developed independently among the local population?", "query_id": "02a258823df03887bcf1d5bd9bc5c18314016802", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["the site of the Coldrum Stones"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "the site of the Coldrum Stones", "answer_start": 120}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who recorded a local folk belief applied to all of the Medway Megaliths and which had been widespread \"up to the last generation?\"", "query_id": "1cb9c557175ec420f11f0ab4a486abc38ead3b9f", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["John"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "John", "answer_start": 32}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who recorded the folk belief that that it was impossible for anyone to successfully count the number of stones in the monuments?", "query_id": "db244e822be7065fafd62c35989d1c85f12875a1", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["John"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "John", "answer_start": 32}]}, {"question": "What do the Pagans cite as spots marking sources of \"earth energy?\"", "query_id": "c29512920d47ff2eeaa7190d6a6c4a348dc04f2c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Medway Megaliths"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Medway Megaliths", "answer_start": 287}]}]}, "694d73ef4d8f71c81484ba17961c9e7bdc9e0507": {"passage": "A deadly virus released in 1996 wipes out almost all of humanity, forcing survivors to live underground.

The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820.  Physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen\u2014painted after his honeymoon\u2014display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that \"the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art.\"Around this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich, at the behest of his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, visited Friedrich's studio and returned to Saint Petersburg with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, tutor to Alexander II, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist. Zhukovsky remarked that his friend's paintings \"please us by their precision, each of them awakening a memory in our mind.\"Friedrich was acquainted with Philipp Otto Runge, another leading German painter of the Romantic period. He was also a friend of Georg Friedrich Kersting, and painted him at work in his unadorned studio, and of the Norwegian painter Johan Christian Clausen Dahl (1788\u20131857). Dahl was close to Friedrich during the artist's final years, and he expressed dismay that to the art-buying public, Friedrich's pictures were only \"curiosities\". While the poet Zhukovsky appreciated Friedrich's psychological themes, Dahl praised the descriptive quality of Friedrich's landscapes, commenting that \"artists and connoisseurs saw in Friedrich's art only a kind of mystic, because they themselves were only looking out for the mystic... They did not see Friedrich's faithful and conscientious study of nature in everything he represented\".During this period Friedrich frequently sketched memorial monuments and sculptures for mausoleums, reflecting his obsession with death and the afterlife; he even created designs for some of the funerary art in Dresden's cemeteries. Some of these works were lost in the fire that destroyed Munich's Glass Palace (1931) and later in the 1945 bombing of Dresden.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_David_Friedrich", "title": "Caspar David Friedrich", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the full name of the person whose assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist?", "query_id": "188625bbe70ee6cce1dc1a95787f3b5c7258f60a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Vasily Zhukovsky"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Vasily Zhukovsky", "answer_start": 1175}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person who expressed dismay that to the art-buying public, Friedrich's pictures were only \"curiosities\"?", "query_id": "b9c803d340884a182a50da73a142b6173a6adae9", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Johan Christian Clausen Dahl"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Johan Christian Clausen Dahl", "answer_start": 1862}]}]}, "fc85ea0fd7ff03576aafc3268b83ca38f7914c25": {"passage": "Elgin and David lead a promising dance crew in Los Angeles, California who participate in street dancing battles at a warehouse owned by a local club owner, Mr. Rad.

Leaderless when it first began, it was the first major threat to Soviet control since the Red Army drove Nazi Germany from its territory at the End of World War II in Europe.\nThe revolt began as a student protest, which attracted thousands as they marched through central Budapest to the Hungarian Parliament building, calling out on the streets using a van with loudspeakers. A student delegation, entering the radio building to try to broadcast the students' demands, was detained. When the delegation's release was demanded by the protesters outside, they were fired upon from within the building by the State Security Police, known as the \u00c1VH (acronym for \u00c1llam V\u00e9delmi Hat\u00f3s\u00e1g, literally \"State Protection Authority\"). One student died and was wrapped in a flag and held above the crowd. This was the start of the revolution. As the news spread, disorder and violence erupted throughout the capital.\nThe revolt spread quickly across Hungary, and the government collapsed. Thousands organised into militias, battling the \u00c1VH and Soviet troops. Pro-Soviet communists and \u00c1VH members were often executed or imprisoned, and former political prisoners were released and armed. Radical impromptu workers' councils wrested municipal control from the ruling Hungarian Working People's Party and demanded political changes. A new government formally disbanded the \u00c1VH, declared its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and pledged to re-establish free elections. By the end of October, fighting had almost stopped, and a sense of normality began to return.\nInitially appearing open to negotiating a withdrawal of Soviet forces, the Politburo changed its mind and moved to crush the revolution. On 4 November, a large Soviet force invaded Budapest and other regions of the country. The Hungarian resistance continued until 10 November. Over 2,500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet troops were killed in the conflict, and 200,000 Hungarians fled as refugees. Mass arrests and denunciations continued for months thereafter. By January 1957, the new Soviet-installed government had suppressed all public opposition. These Soviet actions, while strengthening control over the Eastern Bloc, alienated many Western Marxists, leading to splits and/or considerable losses of membership for communist parties in capitalist states.\nPublic discussion about the revolution was suppressed in Hungary for more than 30 years. Since the thaw of the 1980s, it has been a subject of intense study and debate.

Frank Parnell. The policeman opens the trunk, sees a blinding flash of white light, and is instantly vaporized, leaving only his boots behind.\nOtto Maddox, a young punk rocker in L.A., is fired from his job as a supermarket stock clerk. His girlfriend leaves him for his best friend. Depressed and broke, Otto is wandering the streets when a man named Bud drives up and offers him $25 to drive a car out of the neighborhood.\nOtto follows Bud in the car to the Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation, where he learns that the car he drove was being repossessed. He refuses to join Bud as a \"repo man,\" and goes to his parents' house. He learns that his burned-out ex-hippie parents have donated the money they promised him for finishing school to a crooked televangelist. He decides to take the repo job.\nAfter repossessing a flashy red Cadillac, Otto sees a girl named Leila running down the street. He gives her a ride to her workplace, the United Fruitcake Outlet. On the way, Leila shows Otto pictures of aliens that she says are in the trunk of a Chevy Malibu. She claims that they are dangerous because of the radiation that they emit. Meanwhile, Helping Hand is offered a $20,000 bounty notice for the Malibu. Most assume that the car is drug-related, because the bounty is so far above the actual value of the car.\nParnell arrives in L.A. driving the Malibu, but he is unable to meet his waiting UFO compatriots because of a team of government agents led by a woman with a metal hand. When Parnell pulls into a gas station, Helping Hand's competitors, the Rodriguez brothers, take the Malibu. They stop for sodas because the car's trunk is so hot.

The nation's infrastructure was being developed, with progress in the construction of railroads, the electric telegraph and steamship lines uniting Brazil into a cohesive national entity. After five years in office, the successful conservative cabinet was dismissed and in September 1853, Hon\u00f3rio Hermeto Carneiro Le\u00e3o, Marquis of Paran\u00e1, head of the Conservative Party, was charged with forming a new cabinet. Emperor Pedro II wanted to advance an ambitious plan, which became known as \"the Conciliation\", aimed at strengthening parliament's role in settling the country's political disputes.Paran\u00e1 invited several liberals to join the conservative ranks and went so far as to name some as ministers. The new cabinet, although highly successful, was plagued from the start by strong opposition from ultraconservative members of the Conservative Party who repudiated the new liberal recruits. They believed that the cabinet had become a political machine infested with converted liberals who did not genuinely share the party's ideals and were primarily interested in gaining public offices. Despite this mistrust, Paran\u00e1 showed resilience in fending off threats and overcoming obstacles and setbacks. However, in September 1856, at the height of his career, he died unexpectedly, although the cabinet survived him until May 1857.The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the moderate conservatives who supported the Conciliation. The ultraconservatives were led by Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Viscount of Itabora\u00ed, Eus\u00e9bio de Queir\u00f3s and Paulino Soares de Sousa, 1st Viscount of Uruguai\u2014all former ministers in the 1848\u20131853 cabinet.

The band announced on their website that they would start recording their tenth album on January 31, 2011, at the Atlantis/Metronome studios in Stockholm, once again with Jens Bogren (engineering) and Steven Wilson from Porcupine Tree as co-producer.Shortly after mixing was complete on the new album in April 2011, Opeth announced that Per Wiberg was relieved of his duties in the band.\nIn the press statement, Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt explained the decision, saying, \"Mendez, Axe and Fredrik and I came to the decision that we should find a replacement for Per right after the recordings of the new album, and this came as no surprise to Per. He had, in turn, been thinking about leaving, so you could say it was a mutual decision. There's no bad blood, just a relationship that came to an end, and that's that.\"Opeth's tenth album, Heritage, was released on September 14, 2011, to generally favorable reviews. The album sold 19,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release and debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200 chart. Heritage debuted at number four in the band's native country of Sweden.Heritage became the second Opeth album to not feature any death growls and had a much more progressive style than previous albums from the band, something that \u00c5kerfeldt had been wanting to do for some time.The first two songs \u00c5kerfeldt wrote for Heritage were in the style of Watershed. After hearing the songs for the first time, Mart\u00edn M\u00e9ndez told \u00c5kerfeldt that he would be disappointed if the album continued in that direction. Relieved that M\u00e9ndez was not interested in doing another conventional Opeth album, \u00c5kerfeldt scrapped the two songs and started the writing process over in a different style. In the press release for Heritage, Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt revealed that he felt as though he had been building to write the album since he was 19 years old. In a review for Allmusic, Thom Jurek called Heritage the band's most adventurous album, describing the songs as \"drenched in instrumental interludes, knotty key and chord changes, shifting time signatures, clean vocals, and a keyboard-heavy instrumentation that includes Mellotrons, Rhodes pianos, and Hammond organs\".Opeth supported Heritage with a tour that would last for over 200 tour dates. The tour was the band's first with new keyboardist, Joakim Svalberg, who played on the opening track of the album. During the tour, Opeth played with bands such as Katatonia, Pain of Salvation, Mastodon, Ghost and Anathema all over the world in countries such as the United States, Europe, Turkey, India, Japan, Greece, Israel, Latin America and Sweden.

She had originally intended to take one year off, but despite working on material, twelve years passed before her next album release. Her name occasionally cropped up in the media with rumours of a new album release. The press often viewed her as an eccentric recluse, sometimes drawing a comparison with Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens's Great Expectations. In 1998, Bush gave birth to Albert, known as \"Bertie\", fathered by her guitarist and now husband Danny McIntosh. In 2001, Bush was awarded a Q Award as Classic Songwriter. In 2002, she was awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, and performed \"Comfortably Numb\" at David Gilmour's concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London.\nKate Bush's eighth studio album, Aerial, was released on double CD and vinyl in November 2005. The album single \"King of the Mountain\", had its premiere on BBC Radio 2 two months prior. The single entered the UK Downloads Chart at number six, and would become Bush's third-highest-charting single ever in the UK, peaking at number four on the full chart. Aerial entered the UK albums chart at number three, and the US chart at number 48.Aerial, as on Hounds of Love (1985), is divided into two sections, each with its own theme and mood. The first disc, subtitled A Sea of Honey, features a set of unrelated themed songs, including \"King of the Mountain\"; \"Bertie\", a Renaissance-style ode to her son; and \"Joanni\", based on the story of Joan of Arc.

They suspect the palace's owner, Joseph Curwen, is a warlock.\nA young girl wanders up to the palace in a trance-like state. She is led by Curwen and his mistress, Hester, down into the dungeons. The girl is subjected to a strange ritual, in which an unseen creature rises up from a covered pit. The townspeople observe the girl wandering off, and they storm the palace to confront its owner. Though the girl appears unharmed, the townspeople surmise that she has been bewitched to forget what happened to her. They drag Curwen out to a tree where they intend to burn him. The mob leader, Ezra Weeden, insists that they do not harm Hester (to whom he had been previously engaged to marry). Before being burned alive, Curwen puts a curse on Arkham and its inhabitants and their descendants, promising to rise from the grave to take his revenge.\nIn 1875, 110 years later, Curwen's great-great-grandson, Charles Dexter Ward, and his wife Anne arrive in Arkham after inheriting the palace. They find the townsfolk hostile towards them and are disturbed by the horrific deformities that afflict many of Arkham's inhabitants. Charles is surprised by how well he seems to know the palace and struck by his strong resemblance to a portrait of Curwen.

Raised at the luxurious court of Naples, Eleonora was the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici of Tuscany, later the Grand Duke.  On moving into the palace, Cosimo had Vasari enlarge the structure to fit his tastes; the palace was more than doubled by the addition of a new block along the rear.  Vasari also built the Vasari Corridor, an above-ground walkway from Cosimo's old palace and the seat of government, the Palazzo Vecchio, through the Uffizi, above the Ponte Vecchio to the Palazzo Pitti. This enabled the Grand Duke and his family to move easily and safely from their official residence to the Palazzo Pitti. Initially the Palazzo Pitti was used mostly for lodging official guests and for occasional functions of the court, while the Medicis' principal residence remained the Palazzo Vecchio. It was not until the reign of Eleonora's son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria that the palazzo was occupied on a permanent basis and became home to the Medicis' art collection.Land on the Boboli hill at the rear of the palazzo was acquired in order to create a large formal park and gardens, today known as the Boboli Gardens. The landscape architect employed for this was the Medici court artist Niccol\u00f2 Tribolo, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the corps de logis of the palazzo. The first play recorded as performed there was Andria by Terence in 1476. It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as Giovan Battista Cini. Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court, they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect Baldassarre Lanci.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Pitti", "title": "Palazzo Pitti", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the building that was sold in 1549 by Buonaccorso Pitti?", "query_id": "7eda84cac53d32d4bd6b8388a9be2b1fcefba5f4", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Palazzo Pitti"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Palazzo Pitti", "answer_start": 580}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the structure Cosimo had Vasari enlarge to fit his tastes on moving into the palace?", "query_id": "b691435b1a07f82f6cc67c6ae8075a640f57219c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Palazzo Pitti"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Palazzo Pitti", "answer_start": 580}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the palace that was more than doubled by the addition of a new block along the rear?", "query_id": "a343589255ec2f101e9b731e6f72025b16054978", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Palazzo Pitti"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Palazzo Pitti", "answer_start": 580}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the Grand Duke whose family was enabled to move easily and safely from their official residence?", "query_id": "610d09aa729798a7d77011af6675507e144fc1d8", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Cosimo"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Cosimo", "answer_start": 460}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the official residence from which the Grand Duke and his family was able to move easily and safely?", "query_id": "6e11c30551db1ba1c86a6612e2fac1bc05915414", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Palazzo Vecchio"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Palazzo Vecchio", "answer_start": 512}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the palazzo for which it was not until the reign of Eleonora's son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria that it was occupied on a permanent basis?", "query_id": "49764b5b4c8408d32b865c89e6f1c2520896c92b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Palazzo Pitti"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Palazzo Pitti", "answer_start": 730}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the palazzo that became home to the Medicis' art collection during the reign of Francesco I?", "query_id": "b090dfcc33dda31ccc2b0a87306e48875c45f688", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Palazzo Pitti"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Palazzo Pitti", "answer_start": 701}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person who quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati?", "query_id": "b258d5f7a2abbd9e4ff1fa920e3ae4f0b040ce65", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Niccol\u00f2 Tribolo"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Niccol\u00f2 Tribolo", "answer_start": 1308}]}]}, "ee5edcc3f2977d961eba6c390ef8d79d76104862": {"passage": "By 1796, subscriptions to the edition had dropped by two-thirds.

He said that excepting that from His Lear by Sharpe, that from Northcote's children in the Tower, and some small ones, there were few that could be approved.  Such a mixture of dotting and engraving, and such a general deficiency in respect of drawing which He observed the Engravers seemed to know little of, that the volumes presented a mass of works which He did not wonder many subscribers had declined to continue their subscription.\nThe mix of engraving styles was criticised; line engraving was considered the superior form and artists and subscribers disliked the mixture of lesser forms with it. Moreover, Boydell's engravers fell behind schedule, delaying the entire project. He was forced to engage lesser artists, such as Hamilton and Smirke, at a lower price to finish the volumes as his business started to fail. Modern art historians have generally concurred that the quality of the engravings, particularly in the folio, was poor. Moreover, the use of so many different artists and engravers led to a lack of stylistic cohesion.Although the Boydells ended with 1,384 subscriptions, the rate of subscriptions dropped, and remaining subscriptions were also increasingly in doubt.  Like many businesses at the time, the Boydell firm kept few records. Only the customers knew what they had purchased.  This caused numerous difficulties with debtors who claimed they had never subscribed or had subscribed for less.

By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty aimed for the viewer to feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge.\nThe works Etty painted following his return began to show a departure in style from his previous efforts.

New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; Ulm, Nuremberg, Vienna and Munich were the most important artistic centres in the Holy Roman Empire at the start of the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for printmaking (using woodcuts or copperplate engraving) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy. Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive artists such as Jan Gossaert made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. Gerard David linked the styles of Bruges and Antwerp, often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local painters' guild, and the two became friends.By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht D\u00fcrer emulated van Eyck's precision. Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. Hieronymus Bosch, active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters. He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences. His better-known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory, drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck's Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych. Bosch followed his own muse, tending instead towards moralism and pessimism. His paintings, especially the triptychs, are among the most significant and accomplished of the late Netherlandish period\nThe Reformation brought changes in outlook and artistic expression as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery was shown in a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background. Pieter Bruegel the Elder, one of the few who followed Bosch's style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern. Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological, and his genre scenes were complex, with overtones of religious skepticism and even hints of nationalism.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Netherlandish_painting", "title": "Early Netherlandish painting", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the full name of the Netherlandish painter who was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective?", "query_id": "4404986bf22c6a6e640fe4c14c0cce0cff7c138e", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Hieronymus Bosch"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Hieronymus Bosch", "answer_start": 1406}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the Netherlandish painter whose work is almost entirely free of Italian influences?", "query_id": "1b5ff7c4849287d0407fb1b7578930e39e86a2ac", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Hieronymus Bosch"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Hieronymus Bosch", "answer_start": 1406}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person whose better-known works are characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory?", "query_id": "d025c2b17ec72ad4bdefe1a6abb92433f6be7ba0", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Hieronymus Bosch"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Hieronymus Bosch", "answer_start": 1406}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person whose paintings, especially the triptychs, are among the most significant and accomplished of the late Netherlandish period?", "query_id": "e007a7a21ca20fbfe4f516bcf5171c4483c6e6b2", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Hieronymus Bosch"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Hieronymus Bosch", "answer_start": 1406}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person whose work retains many 15th-century conventions but whose perspective and subjects are distinctly modern?", "query_id": "09edde165e57a28d53e7855632bcb0480d630cb7", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Pieter Bruegel the Elder"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Pieter Bruegel the Elder", "answer_start": 2399}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person who became friends with the head of the local painters' guild when he moved to Antwerp in 1505?", "query_id": "bf07657896abe33d5e54288c4da57d9da5fd5343", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Gerard David"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Gerard David", "answer_start": 807}]}]}, "961f6fa571e5d9442a30a15cd3b7fbd44e0e1fa3": {"passage": "There are more than 20 major dams on the Willamette's tributaries, as well as a complex series of levees, dikes, and channels to control the river's flow.\nThe only dam on the Willamette's main stem is the Willamette Falls Dam, a low weir-type structure at Willamette Falls that diverts water into the headraces of the adjacent mills and a power plant.

While Corgan knew many of the songs would be difficult or impossible to replicate from their recorded versions in concert (in fact, some songs were drastically altered for live performance), he has explained the use of overdubbing by posing the question \"When you are faced with making a permanent recorded representation of a song, why not endow it with the grandest possible vision?\" This use of multilayered sounds was inspired by Corgan's love of 1970s popular artists & bands such as: David Bowie, Cheap Trick, Queen, Boston, and the Electric Light Orchestra, as well as shoegaze, a British alternative rock style of the late 1980s and early 1990s that relied on swirling layers of guitar noise for effect. Mellon Collie coproducer Alan Moulder was originally hired to mix Siamese Dream because Corgan was a fan of his work producing shoegaze bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Ride, and Slowdive.Like many contemporary alternative bands, the Smashing Pumpkins utilized shifts in song dynamics, going from quiet to loud and vice versa. H\u00fcsker D\u00fc's seminal album Zen Arcade demonstrated to the band how they could place gentler material against more aggressive fare, and Corgan made such shifts in dynamics central to the pursuit of his grand musical ambitions.

Worlds End State Park is open during the winter months for snow mobiling and cross-country skiing.

This trail follows the ridges and streams of the Loyalsock Creek watershed. The trail is primarily within the boundaries of Loyalsock State Forest and uses some old logging roads and abandoned railroad grades. The Loyalsock Trail was originally blazed in a yellow rectangle with a red stripe, and red can lids with a yellow \"LT\". Recently, the trail markers have been changed to a yellow disc with a red \"LT\".\nLink Trail is a moderate 8.5-mile (13.7 km) trail marked with a red X on a yellow circle blaze. The trail starts at the Cabin Bridge in the park and follows Loyalsock Creek before it branches off and follows Double Run. The trail then ascends to Canyon Vista and heads out into Loyalsock State Forest where it links up with the Loyalsock Trail at the 55.33-mile (89.05 km) post. The Loyalsock Trail can be followed back for a 17.62 miles (28.36 km) long loop.\nCanyon Vista Trail is a 3.5-mile (5.6 km) loop trail with blue blazes that passes through the eastern portion of the park and a stand of ash, sugar maple, and black cherry trees. This trail passes a maze-like jumble of blocky Pottsville Formation rocks known as the Rock Garden, adjacent to Canyon Vista. The vista is at an elevation of 1,750 feet (530 m) and \"rewards the hiker with a spectacular view of the Loyalsock Creek gorge\".\nWorlds End Trail is a 3.25-mile (5.23 km) trail with yellow blazes that begins at the park office and ascends to an overlook of the swimming area.

He was the youngest of the four children of Alexis Massenet (1788\u20131863) and his second wife El\u00e9onore-Adela\u00efde n\u00e9e Royer de Marancour (1809\u20131875); the elder children were Julie, L\u00e9on and Edmond. Massenet senior was a prosperous ironmonger; his wife was a talented amateur musician who gave Jules his first piano lessons. By early 1848 the family had moved to Paris, where they settled in a flat in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. Massenet was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Louis and, from either 1851 or 1853, the Paris Conservatoire. According to his colourful but unreliable memoirs, Massenet auditioned in October 1851, when he was nine, before a judging panel comprising Daniel Auber, Fromental Hal\u00e9vy, Ambroise Thomas and Michele Carafa, and was admitted at once. His biographer Demar Irvine dates the audition and admission as January 1853. Both sources agree that Massenet continued his general education at the lyc\u00e9e in tandem with his musical studies.\nAmbroise Thomas, my beloved master, came towards me and said, \"Embrace Berlioz, you owe him a great deal for your prize.\" \"The prize,\" I cried, bewildered, my face shining with joy. \"I have the prize!!!\" I was deeply moved and I embraced Berlioz, then my master, and finally Monsieur Auber. Monsieur Auber comforted me. Did I need comforting? Then he said to Berlioz pointing to me, \"He'll go far, the young rascal, when he's had less experience!\"\nThe prize brought a well-subsidised three-year period of study, two-thirds of which was spent at the French Academy in Rome, based at the Villa Medici. At that time the academy was dominated by painters rather than musicians; Massenet enjoyed his time there, and made lifelong friendships with, among others, the sculptor Alexandre Falgui\u00e8re and the painter Carolus-Duran, but the musical benefit he derived was largely self-taught. He absorbed the music at St Peter's, and closely studied the works of the great German masters, from Handel and Bach to contemporary composers. During his time in Rome, Massenet met Franz Liszt, at whose request he gave piano lessons to Louise-Constance \"Ninon\" de Gressy, the daughter of one of Liszt's rich patrons.

However, a rock band called Television arrives at the bar and auditions. Seeing potential, Kristal books them. CBGB soon becomes a rock venue that caters to the burgeoning punk movement. New acts such as Blondie, Patti Smith, Talking Heads and The Ramones begin to get noticed by playing at the club. The fledgling fanzine Punk also gets its start by reporting on the bands and debating the movement's ideology (or lack thereof).\nDespite CBGB's newfound success, Kristal poorly manages the club's funds (he keeps the money in his apartment freezer) and fails to regularly pay bills or rent.

Seeking inspiration from German reunification, they began work on their seventh studio album, Achtung Baby, at Berlin's Hansa Studios in October 1990 with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno. The sessions were fraught with conflict, as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material. While Clayton and Mullen preferred a sound similar to U2's previous work, Bono and the Edge were inspired by European industrial music and electronic dance music and advocated a change. Weeks of tension and slow progress nearly prompted the group to break up until they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song \"One\". They returned to Dublin in 1991, where morale improved and the majority of the album was completed.\nAchtung Baby was released in November 1991. The album represented a calculated change in musical and thematic direction for the group; the shift was one of their most dramatic since The Unforgettable Fire. Sonically, the record incorporated influences from alternative rock, dance, and industrial music of the time, and Bono referred to its musical departure as \"four men chopping down the Joshua Tree\". Thematically, it was a more introspective and personal record; it was darker, yet at times more flippant than the band's previous work. Commercially and critically, it has been one of the band's most successful albums. It produced five hit singles, including \"The Fly\", \"Mysterious Ways\", and \"One\", and it was a crucial part of the band's early 1990s reinvention. In 1993, Achtung Baby won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.

Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience\u2014Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.\" Dave Marsh calls the performance one of \"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\".By January 1969, the single \"If I Can Dream\", written for the special, reached number 12. The soundtrack album rose into the top ten. According to friend Jerry Schilling, the special reminded Presley of what \"he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack. ... He was out of prison, man.\" Binder said of Presley's reaction, \"I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life.

The Greatest Hits Video Collection DVD was also released at the same time. This was a compilation of all of the Pumpkins promo videos from Gish to Machina along with unreleased material. Vieuphoria was released on DVD in 2002, as was the soundtrack album Earphoria, previously released solely to radio stations in 1994.\nBilly Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin reunited in 2001 as members of Corgan's next project, the short-lived supergroup Zwan. The group's only album, Mary Star of the Sea, was released in 2003. After cancelling a few festival appearances, Corgan announced the demise of the band in 2003. During 2001 Corgan also toured as part of New Order and provided vocals on their comeback album Get Ready. In October 2004 Corgan released his first book, Blinking with Fists, a collection of poetry. In June 2005, he released a solo album, TheFutureEmbrace, which he described as \"(picking) up the thread of the as-of-yet-unfinished work of the Smashing Pumpkins\". Despite this, it was greeted with generally mixed reviews and lackluster sales. Only one single, \"Walking Shade\", was released in support of the album.\nIn addition to drumming with Zwan, Jimmy Chamberlin also formed an alternative rock/jazz fusion project band called Jimmy Chamberlin Complex. The group released an album in 2005 titled Life Begins Again. Corgan provided guest vocals on the track \"Lokicat\". James Iha served as a guitarist in A Perfect Circle, appearing on their Thirteenth Step club tour and 2004 album, eMOTIVe.

That was never the plan.\" On February 17, 2004, Corgan posted a message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a \"mean-spirited drug addict\" and blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins. On June 3, 2004, he added that \"the depth of my hurt [from Iha] is only matched with the depth of my gratitude\". Iha responded to Corgan's claims in 2005, saying, \"No, I didn't break up the band.

Whereas today it is surrounded by sea, the water level was much lower in prehistoric times, when the polar ice caps were larger. The current peninsula was surrounded by a fertile coastal plain, with marshes and sand dunes supporting an abundant variety of animals and plants.Neanderthals are known to have lived in caves around the Rock of Gibraltar; in 1848 the first known adult Neanderthal skull, and only the second Neanderthal fossil ever found, was excavated at Forbes' Quarry on the north face of the Rock. Had the skull been recognised for what it was, the species might have been named Gibraltarians rather than Neanderthals. The date of the skull is unclear but it has been attributed to around the start of the last glacial period about 50,000 years ago.More Neanderthal remains have been found elsewhere on the Rock at Devil's Tower and in Ibex, Vanguard and Gorham's Caves on the east side of Gibraltar. Excavations in Gorham's Cave have found evidence of Neanderthal occupation dated as recently as 28,000\u201324,000 years ago, well after they were believed to have died out elsewhere in Europe. The caves of Gibraltar continued to be used by Homo sapiens after the final extinction of the Neanderthals.

He was baptised as \"Fritz Theodor Albert Delius\", and used the forename Fritz until he was about 40. He was the second of four sons (there were also ten daughters) born to Julius Delius (1822\u20131901) and his wife Elise Pauline, n\u00e9e Kr\u00f6nig (1838\u20131929). Delius's parents were born in Bielefeld, Westphalia, of Dutch origin; the family had for some generations been settled in German lands near the Rhine. Julius's father, Ernst Friedrich Delius, had served under Bl\u00fccher in the Napoleonic Wars. Julius moved to England to further his career as a wool merchant, and became a naturalised British subject in 1850. He married Elise in 1856.The Delius household was musical; famous musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Carlo Alfredo Piatti were guests, and played for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz was drawn to the music of Chopin and Grieg rather than the Austro-German music of Mozart and Beethoven, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller of the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra, and had more advanced studies under Mr. George Haddock of Leeds. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at Bradford Grammar School, where the singer John Coates was his slightly older contemporary. He then attended the International College at Isleworth (just west of London) between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to the city for Delius to be able to attend concerts and opera.Julius Delius assumed that his son would play a part in the family wool business, and for the next three years he tried hard to persuade him to do so. Delius's first job was as the firm's representative in Stroud in Gloucestershire, where he did moderately well. After being sent in a similar capacity to Chemnitz, he neglected his duties in favour of trips to the major musical centres of Germany, and musical studies with Hans Sitt. His father sent him to Sweden, where he again put his artistic interests ahead of commerce, coming under the influence of the Norwegian dramatists Henrik Ibsen and Gunnar Heiberg. Ibsen's denunciations of social conventions further alienated Delius from his commercial background. Delius was then sent to represent the firm in France, but he frequently absented himself from business for excursions to the French Riviera. After this, Julius Delius recognised that there was no prospect that his son would succeed in the family business, but he remained opposed to music as a profession, and instead sent him to America to manage an orange plantation.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Delius", "title": "Frederick Delius", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Where was Julius Delius born?", "query_id": "ca56de7e2fac5b393ec53a62b100b7187b767ac4", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Bielefeld, Westphalia"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Bielefeld, Westphalia", "answer_start": 322}]}, {"question": "Where was Elise Pauline, n\u00e9e Kr\u00f6nig born?", "query_id": "bb732d72584f794c411e46bb431182298bd590c1", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Bielefeld, Westphalia"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Bielefeld, Westphalia", "answer_start": 322}]}, {"question": "What was the full name of the person that was taught violin by Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller?", "query_id": "18c5482f109074c72e911886a29c4c87e39cadb0", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Fritz Theodor Albert Delius"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Fritz Theodor Albert Delius", "answer_start": 62}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person that had more advanced studies under Mr. George Haddock of Leeds?", "query_id": "ea15712e964a10b5dbf20ae26345a2f6a04f8331", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Fritz Theodor Albert Delius"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Fritz Theodor Albert Delius", "answer_start": 62}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person that attended the International College at Isleworth?", "query_id": "6fec61aa362f93beeb7064098f41250f98682a26", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Fritz Theodor Albert Delius"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Fritz Theodor Albert Delius", "answer_start": 62}]}, {"question": "What location was Fritz Theodor Albert Delius's first job?", "query_id": "3f41ba7135eafdf9d2bfed2efdb78a737bd80e55", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Stroud in Gloucestershire"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Stroud in Gloucestershire", "answer_start": 2013}]}, {"question": "What are the full names of the people that influenced Fritz Theodor Albert Delius in Sweden?", "query_id": "e8567f45b6c7c2626efb09d8697104f22d7afaf3", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Henrik Ibsen", "Gunnar Heiberg"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Henrik Ibsen", "answer_start": 2389}, {"text": "Gunnar Heiberg", "answer_start": 2406}]}, {"question": "What was the final place Julius Delius sent Fritz Theodor Albert Delius for business?", "query_id": "24b5c65cb4f670e3f5731d2eb13224c1ad80d8eb", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["America"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "America", "answer_start": 2853}]}]}, "14163da6b7818a7cd3defb32971be4575cc647e3": {"passage": "Returning to Danes Island in the summer of 1897, the expedition found that the balloon hangar built the year before had weathered the winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too. Andr\u00e9e had strengthened his leadership by replacing the older and critical Ekholm, an authority in his field, with the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Fr\u00e6nkel.On 11 July, in a steady wind from the south-west, the top of the plank hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andr\u00e9e dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper Aftonbladet, holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last ropes holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out low over the water, it was pulled so far down by the friction of the several-hundred-meter-long drag ropes against the ground as to dip the basket into the water. The friction also twisted the ropes around, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new safety feature that Andr\u00e9e had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby ropes that got caught on the ground could be more easily dropped.\nMost of them unscrewed at once and 530 kilograms (1,170 lb) of rope were lost, while the three explorers could simultaneously be seen to dump 210 kilograms (460 lb) of sand overboard to get the basket clear of the water. Seven hundred and forty kilograms (1,630 lb) of essential weight was thus lost in the first few minutes. Before it was well clear of the launch site, the Eagle had turned from a supposedly steerable craft into an ordinary hydrogen balloon with a few ropes hanging from it, at the mercy of the wind; its crew had no means to direct it to any particular goal and had too little ballast for stability. Lightened, the balloon rose to 700 metres (2,300 ft), an unimagined height, where the lower air pressure made the hydrogen escape all the faster through the eight million little holes.\nThe balloon had two means of communication with the outside world, buoys and homing pigeons. The buoys, steel cylinders encased in cork, were intended to be dropped from the balloon into the water or onto the ice, to be carried to civilization by the currents. Only two buoy messages have ever been found. One was dispatched by Andr\u00e9e on 11 July, a few hours after takeoff, and reads \"Our journey goes well so far. We sail at an altitude of about 250 m (820 ft), at first N 10\u00b0 east, but later N 45\u00b0 east [...] Weather delightful.

Although Franti\u0161ek now agreed that his son should follow a musical career, he could not provide financial support. In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty gulden, and no immediate prospects. Lacking any formal musical training, he needed a teacher, and was introduced by Kate\u0159ina Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1's mother to Josef Proksch, head of the Prague Music Institute\u2014where Kate\u0159ina was now studying. Proksch used the most modern teaching methods, drawing on Beethoven, Chopin, Berlioz and the Leipzig circle of Liszt. In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, and at the same time the young musician's financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun.For the next three years, besides teaching piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, bagatelles, impromptus and the G minor Piano Sonata. In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French composer at a reception arranged by Proksch. At the home of Count Thun he met Robert and Clara Schumann, and showed them his G minor sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work\u2014they detected too much of Berlioz in it.

School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum.\nThe student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \"pointing machine\", a technique called \"pointing\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing machine.In 1924, Moore won a six-month travelling scholarship which he spent in Northern Italy studying the great works of Michelangelo, Giotto di Bondone, Giovanni Pisano and several other Old Masters.

This shipbuilding style was adapted mainly for smaller ships in the shallow coastal waters of the Netherlands, and allowed for quick construction, but these less sturdy vessels were generally unsuitable as warships and somewhat unstable in rough seas. When Kronan was built, the English approach to building had prevailed, giving hulls a more rounded bottom and greater draft, as well as a sturdier frame and increased stability. The stern was more streamlined below the waterline, which lessened resistance.The measurements for Kronan were recorded in contemporary navy lists. Its length from stem post to stern post was 53 m (174 ft); this was considerably shorter than the length if the bowsprit and beakhead were included. The width was 12.9 m (42 ft) and was defined as the widest point between the frames, excluding planking. The draft varied depending on how heavily she was laden, but with full stores, ammunition and armaments it would have been about 6.2\u20136.8 m (20\u201322 ft). The height of the ship from keel to the highest mast was never recorded, but Kalmar County Museum has estimated it to have been at least 66 m (217 ft).Kronan's displacement \u2013 the ship's weight calculated by how much water it displaced while floating \u2013 is not known precisely, since there are no exact records of the dimensions. By using contemporary documents describing the approximate measurements, it has been estimated at around 2,300 tonnes. By its displacement in relation to the number and weight of guns, Kronan was over-gunned, though this was not uncommon for the era. European shipwrights had not been building three-deckers on a large scale before the 1650s; by the 1660s, designs were still quite experimental. Contemporary records show that English and French three-deckers tended to be rather unstable because they were built high, narrow and with too much artillery. Some English ships had to be reinforced with a \"girdle\" of built-up planking at the waterline to perform satisfactorily. In rough seas these ships could be forced to close the lowest row of gunports, depriving them of their heaviest and most effective guns. In these situations they were effectively just over-priced two-deckers. Kronan's construction was not inherently flawed; the ship handled harsh weather conditions in 1675 and again only a week before capsizing, but she could be dangerous if handled poorly. Later, during the 18th century, ships with the same weight of guns had more tonnage to support their guns, usually weighing 3,000\u20135,000 tonnes, which made them more stable. When Kronan was built, she was the third or fourth largest ship in the world, but as the trend moved towards ever greater ships, she was surpassed by other large warships. At the time Kronan sank, she was down to seventh place.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronan_(ship)", "title": "Kronan (ship)", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What had a width of 42 feet?", "query_id": "510b33d965e6a7ea8ea776b1b1bbc0c2cb9df86a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Kronan"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Kronan", "answer_start": 673}]}, {"question": "What was estimated to be at least 217 feet?", "query_id": "0549bb9e9e1dab2fcd323b076e4c1db32950c1f1", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The height of the ship"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The height of the ship", "answer_start": 1127}]}, {"question": "What was estimated to be around 2,300 tonnes?", "query_id": "a886d003ca00cb23a787b2dfab9b80dcc5605543", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Kronan's displacement"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Kronan's displacement", "answer_start": 1278}]}]}, "4f6ef25b2150a85d191a21b83800d67cca3ac606": {"passage": "Yosemite Sam is the royal chef for a spoiled king (a caricature of Charles Laughton, who frequently played kings and similar heads of state).

He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones.\nFollowing the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. (Etty's male nude portraits were primarily of mythological heroes and classical combat, genres in which the depiction of male nudity was considered acceptable in England.) From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work.", "wiki_url":

When Bobby's grandfather falls and breaks his arm due to an approaching storm, Bobby is left on the farm alone while his mother accompanies his grandfather to the hospital.\nDuring this storm, a \"vortex in time\" is created and deposits \"Captain\" Jezebel Jack, a self-centered pirate who was forced to walk the plank on his own ship and sent into the vortex. Jack awakes in a field of wheat, where he finds Bobby, who tends to his wounds after he loses consciousness again.\nWhile adapting to the advances of modern technology (such as a television), Jack is told of an old buried treasure map by Bobby, and demands they follow the map. Bobby explains that his grandfather explained to him the story, and that the map is written in some unknown code. Jack says that the map is in \"Adventurer's Code\", in which he is fluent. The two immediately begin to follow the map, and quickly find the treasure buried under an old tool shed.\nShortly after uncovering the treasure, another vortex in time is opened, and the rest of Jack's mutinied crew is deposited.

Under Norman rule, the town had one of the strongest castles in southern England. Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland.\nThe port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls. By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. There was also an important Jewish community in Bristol from the late 12th century through to the late 13th century when all Jews were expelled from England. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s. The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373, the first town in England to be given this status. During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre. By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London. One-third to one-half of the population died in the Black Death of 1348\u201349, which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "title": "Bristol", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What was the name that was on the pennies produced by the mint in about 1020?", "query_id": "7dc192676e015a2d656fe21b443c5842ae5d0d9a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Bristol"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Bristol", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "What was the first town in England to be given county status?

In 1982, an exhibition of his work: \u2018John Michael Wright \u2013 The King\u2019s Painter\u2019 \u2013 in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery \u2013 led to a renewed interest in his contributions, and the catalogue (edited by Sara Stevenson and Duncan Thomson) re-wrote and uncovered much of the known biographical details. New works continue to be discovered and previously known ones re-attributed to him. Wright is now viewed as amongst the most successful of seventeenth-century Britain's indigenous artists, and is rated alongside contemporaries such as Robert Walker and William Dobson. One modern exhibition catalogue described him as \"the finest seventeenth century British-born painter\". Certainly, he was one of the few who painted the elite aristocracy of his day, and was responsible for some of the most magnificent royal portraiture surviving. This achievement is particularly significant in an age where even British patrons had tended to favour foreign artists like Holbein and Van Dyck, and would continue to favour immigrants such as Lely and Kneller. Indeed, part of the reason for Wright's success is recognised as being his unusually cosmopolitan training: no prior British artist had so much exposure to European influence.

He confronts Fenton, who admits to his affair with Vivien, and persuades him to end the relationship by writing her a farewell letter.

Trio, who had previously released a compilation of Coleman's 1966 to 1971 live performances in Paris, prepared to press the album once Mwanga provided the label with the record stamper. Coleman was also set to perform his song \"Skies of America\" with the NHK Symphony Orchestra, but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and Sid Bernstein as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to Island Records. He signed with the record label that year, and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label Antilles Records. Billboard magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.According to jazz writer Francis Davis, \"a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent\" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point. The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by Mandel, who described its production as \"the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere\". Of Human Feelings had no success on the American pop charts, only charting on the Top Jazz Albums, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15. Because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz, McRae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners. Sound & Vision critic Brent Butterworth speculated that it was overlooked because it had electric instruments, rock and funk drumming, and did not conform to what he felt was the hokey image of jazz that many of the genre's fans preferred.

Los Lobotomys formed in the mid-1980s and played regular shows in the Los Angeles area, often inviting whatever session musicians happened to be available and in the area. They recorded an album under the Los Lobotomys name in 1989, and the band was heavily involved in the recording of Lukather's Candyman. Los Lobotomys recorded a live album in 2004 comprising several tracks from Candyman and from the 1989 album.In 1998, Lukather received an invitation to tour Japan with fellow guitarist Larry Carlton after Japanese promoters requested that Carlton's annual tours each be different from the last. Lukather and Carlton exchanged some recorded material and decided that a collaboration would be interesting. Lukather was flattered by the invitation to tour with Carlton, citing him as his favorite guitarist. Lukather speaks highly of their stage efforts, although the two were admittedly outside their normal realm of work. He stated in an interview that \"you can hear us having fun on the record\u2014you can hear the smiles on our faces.\" After several shows, the duo realized that they should record their collaboration even if just for their own use. Guitarist and producer Steve Vai heard one of the subsequent recordings and expressed interest in releasing it under his Favored Nations label, also home to such artists as Eric Johnson and Dweezil Zappa. Vai and Lukather mixed and produced the recording, which is said to be a mixture of jazz, blues, and fusion music. The resulting album, No Substitutions: Live in Osaka, won a 2001 Grammy award for Best Pop Instrumental Album. Album reviewers described Lukather as having a heavier style than Carlton. Lukather and Carlton later did an international tour in support of the album.In 2005, Lukather won critical praise for his rendition of the Jimi Hendrix song \"Little Wing\" at a gala 90th birthday celebration for jazz guitarist Les Paul.

He realized the coming importance of the automobile, and in 1911 he campaigned for a project he called \"The Great White Way\", a turnpike between Monte Ne and Muskogee, Oklahoma. Harvey Requested that a \"Good Roads\" meeting be held by the Commercial Club of Rogers; however, they did not feel that it was their meeting because, while fairly well attended, hardly any Rogers businessmen were present. Harvey assessed the project would cost Rogers $5,000 without their permission or consent, and this estimate was far less than what engineers advising the Rogers businessmen believed the cost would be. Ultimately the \"Great White Way\" project failed, and Harvey blamed the community of Rogers for lack of support.In 1913 he spearhead the founding of The Ozark Trails Association (OTA) to promote the building and education of quality highway design, but not actually building or funding them. At first, he was only interested in bringing people to Monte Ne, he stated: \"My Personal interest in the Ozark Trails is that they all lead to Monte Ne\" However, he seems to have taken on a more egalitarian opinion of the Ozark Trails as time went on because he later said: \"My inclination runs toward doing something of a progressive nature that will promote the collective good, and I have now concentrated all that inclination on carrying out a system of roads known as the Ozark Trails.\" The Ozark Trails Association became Harvey's most successful endeavor. Interest in the project spread, and membership swelled to 7,000 delegates from states as far away as New Mexico. The group built large obelisks, listing the names of the benefactors, along the routes and trails that it sponsored. He even ran for Congress on a platform of building a national highway system, but lost to John W. Tillman who had strong support in Washington County.Interest in the group began to waver noticeably when Harvey finally stepped down as president at a 1920 convention in Pittsburg, Kansas that was attended by only 200 delegates. By the mid-1920s, highways and roads had become completely government-funded and there was no longer a need for local sponsorship. The group's system of giving them historic names and those of contributors had also become confusing and inefficient because of the myriad names and disputes over different names for the same stretch of roadway, so the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) changed all the roadways' names to uniform numbers, despite fierce protest from the OTA. The group had lost its relevance and disbanded in 1924, but many of the roads they helped develop became part of the historic U.S. Route 66.Another group, with no affiliation but with the same name, was created in the early 1970s to promote the maintenance of recreational trails in the Ozarks.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Ne", "title": "Monte Ne", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the person who ran for Congress on a platform of building a national highway system?", "query_id": "4e8c2319e94e6e951d1edf8bf9b010c09e8ba918", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Harvey"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Harvey", "answer_start": 1521}]}]}, "dd68d2b5ce981f0c459141f099d2e2c498acaa61": {"passage": "During the Korean War, the Soviets and Chinese capture a U.S. Army platoon and take it to Manchuria in communist China.

Guitarist David Gilmour expressed feelings about his strained relationship with Waters on his second solo album, About Face (1984), and finished the accompanying tour as Waters began touring to promote his debut solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both had enlisted a range of successful performers, including in Waters' case Eric Clapton, their solo acts attracted fewer fans than Pink Floyd; poor ticket sales forced Gilmour to cancel several concerts, and critic David Fricke felt that Waters' show was \"a petulant echo, a transparent attempt to prove that Roger Waters was Pink Floyd\". Waters returned to the US in March 1985 with a second tour, this time without the support of CBS Records, which had expressed its preference for a new Pink Floyd album; Waters criticised the corporation as \"a machine\".\nAfter drummer Nick Mason attended one of Waters' London performances in 1985, he found he missed touring under the Pink Floyd name. His visit coincided with the release in August of his second solo album, Profiles, on which Gilmour sang. With a shared love of aviation, Mason and Gilmour were taking flying lessons and together bought a de Havilland Dove aeroplane. Gilmour was working on other collaborations, including a performance for Bryan Ferry at 1985's Live Aid concert, and co-produced the Dream Academy's self-titled debut album.In December 1985, Waters announced that he had left Pink Floyd, which he believed was \"a spent force creatively\". After the failure of his About Face tour, Gilmour hoped to continue with the Pink Floyd name. The threat of a lawsuit from Gilmour, Mason and CBS Records was meant to compel Waters to write and produce another Pink Floyd album with his bandmates, who had barely participated in making The Final Cut; Gilmour was especially critical of the album, labelling it \"cheap filler\" and \"meandering rubbish\". The lawsuit left Waters with only one other option: to formally resign from Pink Floyd to protect himself from a lawsuit that, he said, \"would have wiped me out completely\".According to Gilmour, \"I told [Waters] before he left, 'If you go, man, we're carrying on. Make no bones about it, we would carry on', and Roger replied: 'You'll never fucking do it.'\" Waters had written to EMI and Columbia declaring his intention to leave the group and asking them to release him from his contractual obligations. He also dispensed with the services of Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs.

The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film.\nMartin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies.\nThe new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting \"the factory\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket. \nMartin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good. Thus Mr Martin wins his battle of the sexes.

was neither a major commercial nor critical success when it was first released in the United States. Many listeners were convinced that the album was drug-inspired, and interpreted the album's title as slang for a bad LSD trip. The album made the Mothers of Invention immediate underground darlings with a strong counter-cultural following. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa quotes a negative review of the album by Pete Johnson of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote:\nI guess you might call it surrealistic paintings set to music. Not content to record just two sides of musical gibberish, the MOI devote four full sides to their type of \"artistry\". If anyone owns this album, perhaps he can tell me what in hell is going on ... The Mothers of Invention, a talented but warped quintet, have fathered an album poetically entitled Freak Out, which could be the greatest stimulus to the aspirin industry since the income tax.\nThe album developed a major cult following in the United States by the time MGM/Verve had been merged into a division of PolyGram in 1972.  At that time many MGM/Verve releases including Freak Out! were prematurely deleted in an attempt to keep the struggling company financially solvent. Zappa had already moved on to his own companies Bizarre Records and Straight Records which were distributed by Warner Bros. Records. Freak Out! was initially more successful in Europe and quickly influenced many English rock musicians. According to David Fricke, the album was a major influence on the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Paul McCartney regarded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as The Beatles' Freak Out! Zappa criticized the Beatles, as he felt they were \"only in it for the money\".Freak Out! was honored with the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999, ranked at number 243 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" in 2003, and featured in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

The Bulgarian Patriarchate was reduced to an archbishopric, but retained its autocephalous status and its dioceses. Byzantine domestic policies changed after Basil's death and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, the largest being led by Peter Delyan. In 1185 Asen dynasty nobles Ivan Asen I and Peter IV organized a major uprising which resulted in the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with Tarnovo as the capital.\nKaloyan, the third of the Asen monarchs, extended his dominion to Belgrade and Ohrid. He acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of the pope and received a royal crown from a papal legate. The empire reached its zenith under Ivan Asen II (1218\u20131241), when its borders expanded as far as the coast of Albania, Serbia and Epirus, while commerce and culture flourished. Ivan Asen's rule was also marked by a shift away from Rome in religious matters.The Asen dynasty became extinct in 1257. Internal conflicts and incessant Byzantine and Hungarian attacks followed, enabling the Mongols to establish suzerainty over the weakened Bulgarian state. In 1277, swineherd Ivaylo led a great peasant revolt that chased the Mongols out of Bulgaria and briefly made him emperor. He was overthrown in 1280 by the feudal landlords, whose factional conflicts caused the Second Bulgarian Empire to disintegrate into small feudal dominions by the 14th century.

It was the first composed for a feast day, Pentecost Sunday (Whit Sunday), Pentecost being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the Acts of the Apostles, on the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1\u201313), and from the Gospel of John, in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach, in his Farewell discourse (John 14:23\u201331). As in many Bach cantatas, the libretto is compiled from Bible text, contemporary poetry and chorale. The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck, although the verses are not included in his printed editions. Several of Bach's early stylistic mannerisms appear here, such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement, arias following each other without a recitative in between, and dialogue in a duet.Franck's text shows elements of early Pietism: the expression of extreme feelings, for example \"O seligste Zeiten!\" (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a \"mystical demeanour\", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to \"Gott will sich die Seelen zu Tempeln bereiten\" (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His  temple, more literally: \"God wants to prepare [our] souls to become his temples\"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, \"Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten\" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn \"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\", which is based on the Latin hymn \"Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium\". Movement 6 is a chorale, verse four of Philipp Nicolai's hymn \"Wie sch\u00f6n leuchtet der Morgenstern\". Nicolai's \"Geistlich Brautlied\" (Spiritual bridal song) continues the theme of unity between Soul and Spirit.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erschallet,_ihr_Lieder,_erklinget,_ihr_Saiten!_BWV_172", "title": "Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten!, BWV 172", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What books of the Bible are the prescribed readings for the feast day taken from?", "query_id": "73675b247fff4a27410d7dcf29f1a79c51181c10", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Acts of the Apostles", "Gospel of John"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Acts of the Apostles", "answer_start": 260}, {"text": "Gospel of John", "answer_start": 329}]}, {"question": "What are the three high holidays?", "query_id": "d32b9d02025595e8d842aebc2b8ff45a73d97a1e", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Pentecost", "Christmas", "Easter"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Pentecost", "answer_start": 135}, {"text": "Christmas", "answer_start": 177}, {"text": "Easter", "answer_start": 191}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person whose text shows elements of early Pietism?", "query_id": "bde3c5330fd0f170bb3663ac3de397b981d97643", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Salomon Franck"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Salomon Franck", "answer_start": 569}]}, {"question": "What verse from the Gospel text does Franck paraphrase?", "query_id": "51f784244e7e2ef6de54dd92f613a5b16b063388", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["23"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "23", "answer_start": 1239}]}, {"question": "What are the two things that Movement 6 continues the theme of unity between?", "query_id": "9c324b68824579e36962bb1c7c44097e9de01f42", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Soul", "Spirit"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Soul", "answer_start": 2237}, {"text": "Spirit", "answer_start": 2246}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who the poetry of Bach's cantatas is attributed to?", "query_id": "491a14d08491781b3fff99092337019092939cc7", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Franck"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Franck", "answer_start": 577}]}]}, "dff108d402848d0aaf3c4f3a59c766819db2859d": {"passage": "The gang is driving through a desert in Roswell, New Mexico when a sandstorm forces Shaggy to make a wrong turn onto government property.

Governor Macquarie and Commissioner John Bigge laid the foundation stone on 7 October 1819. The building was originally intended to serve as a courthouse as Macquarie had plans for a large cathedral to be built on the present location of St Andrew's Cathedral but they were put on hold by the intervention of Bigge who had been appointed to conduct a Royal Commission into the colonial government. Bigge initially approved of the courthouse project but by February 1820, less than four months after his arrival, he strongly recommended its conversion into a church.\n\"The reason for Bigge's change of mind may be found in the appointment, three years later, of his brother-in-law [and secretary], Mr TH Scott, a wine merchant, as Archdeacon\". The design of the courthouse was modified before construction with the addition of a steeple at the western end, to serve as a church, while the adjacent school buildings were put into use as a courthouse. The first service was held in the unfinished church on the Day of Epiphany, 6 January 1822, the text being from Isaiah, Chapter 60: \"Arise! Shine, for thy light has come. The glory of the Lord has risen upon thee\". It was anticipated in the Sydney Gazette's report of the event that the church, when fitted out with stalls and galleries, would hold 2,000 people.

He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around \u00a37,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25 m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and, in all likelihood, were two of those who shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary. Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night, while the journalist J P Eddy suggests that Svaars was among those present. Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman who wrote a history of the events, considers that those present consisted of Gardstein, Smoller, Peters and Dubof, with a second group in case the work needed to continue into the following day, which included among their number Sokolow and Svaars. Rumbelow considers a third group on standby, staying at Hoffman's lodgings, to have comprised Hoffman, Rosen and Osip Federoff, an unemployed locksmith. Rumbelow also considers that present at the events\u2014either as lookouts or in unknown capacities\u2014were Peter the Painter and Nina Vassilleva.On 16 December, working from the small yard behind 11 Exchange Buildings, the gang began to break through the back wall of the shop; number 10 had been unoccupied since 12 December. At around 10:00 that evening, returning to his home at 120 Houndsditch, Max Weil heard curious noises coming from his neighbour's property. Outside his house Weil found Police Constable Piper on his beat and informed him of the noises. Piper checked at 118 and 121 Houndsditch, where he could hear the noise, which he thought was unusual enough to investigate further. At 11:00 he knocked at the door of 11 Exchange Buildings\u2014the only property with a light on in the back. The door was opened in a furtive manner and Piper became suspicious immediately. So as not to rouse the man's concerns, Piper asked him \"is the missus in?\" The man answered in broken English that she was out, and the policeman said he would return later.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Sidney_Street", "title": "Siege of Sidney Street", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the last name of the man who knocked on the door of 11 Exchange Buildings?", "query_id": "0873115213145601fd77d841be60174b1fa74b46", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Piper"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Piper", "answer_start": 2333}]}, {"question": "What are the full names of the members of the gang that began to break the back wall that were believed to be lookouts?", "query_id": "2125eaf524be949d8f084130a92f35647cce41f0", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Peter the Painter", "Nina Vassilleva"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Peter the Painter", "answer_start": 1877}, {"text": "Nina Vassilleva", "answer_start": 1899}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the man that heard the gang that was breaking in the back wall of the shop?", "query_id": "56c58c575abc344c83ab9f3ff578f84d204e6397", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Max Weil"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Max Weil", "answer_start": 2169}]}, {"question": "What are the names of the members of the gang that used a 60 foot rubber hose that were in the second group?", "query_id": "8b36b9b047e99529a5e86d438205603345f21cde", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Sokolow", "Svaars"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Sokolow", "answer_start": 1604}, {"text": "Svaars", "answer_start": 1616}]}, {"question": " What are the last names of the members of the gang that used a cylinder of compressed gas that were in the third group", "query_id": "6588fc58ec1d2c84f840f1f56e1d9b0d6d91d5d6", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Hoffman", "Rosen", "Federoff"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Hoffman", "answer_start": 1718}, {"text": "Rosen", "answer_start": 1727}, {"text": "Federoff", "answer_start": 1742}]}, {"question": "What is the alias of the person who rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings?", "query_id": "2939f9f6c7b4ef886d98ffb594084a380b757209", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Joe Levi"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Joe Levi", "answer_start": 58}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who found Police Constable Piper on his beat and informed him of the noises?", "query_id": "2fdc9c2d7d4ba0d8ff2a50896bd3d6386bd50e42", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Max"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Max", "answer_start": 2169}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who thought the noise was unusual enough to investigate further?", "query_id": "d93b82e057aa89c0c3a08ba0abeb7d7f733567e3", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Piper"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Piper", "answer_start": 2283}]}, {"question": "What did Piper think was unusual enough to investigate further?", "query_id": "edbefb5c66ce2bd10732523973e7785cef059e31", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["the noise"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "the noise", "answer_start": 2395}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who opined that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night?", "query_id": "547253d653d96e09a06c04c1d3738190726da2d7", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Bernard"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Bernard", "answer_start": 971}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person whose son stated the total at the property was around \u00a37,000?", "query_id": "075c2a266d18b8d70cc040d18c73d6e0181fe8fd", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Henry"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Henry", "answer_start": 408}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who considers a third group on standby?", "query_id": "987e622546b77e3a5f336b33de9e1233582a0a0f", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Donald"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Donald", "answer_start": 1339}]}, {"question": "What shop did the gang begin to break through the back wall of on 16 December?

It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was $5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse. He is very tense at rehearsals, which makes us concentrate, but relaxed during the performance, which is a great asset to the orchestra.\" Peck recalled Solti's constant efforts to improve his own technique and interpretations, at one point experimentally dispensing with a baton, drawing a \"darker and deeper, much more relaxed\" tone from the players.", "wiki_url":

generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72 based on 17 reviews. Uncut called it a \"shiny, trans-atlantic blend of Europop vim, R&B grit and Caribbean bounce.\" Andy Kellman of AllMusic deemed it quintessential pop music and said each of its tracks was a potential hit. Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters praised the album, describing it as \"more raw, perhaps edgier and more risqu\u00e9\" than Rihanna's previous material. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that the album \"sounds as if it were scientifically engineered to deliver hits\". Peter Robinson of The Observer commended her collaborators for \"masking her own shortcomings\" and commented that, \"While Rihanna lacks her peers' charisma, she's a great vessel for exhilarating mainstream pop.\" Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan found the album varied and satisfying. Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly felt that, although it \"goes bad when Rihanna tries her hand at treacly ballads and glum sentiment\", at times Good Girl Gone Bad is a \"thrilling throwback to more than a decade ago, when upstart producers haphazardly mashed R&B with hip-hop to create chunky jeep anthems such as Mary J. Blige's 'Real Love'.\"In a mixed review, Rodney Dugue of The Village Voice felt that the album \"never settles on a sound\" and only cited its three Timbaland-produced songs as highlights. Although he found the ballads to be improvements from Rihanna's previous albums, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani criticized the lyrics, particularly those written by Justin Timberlake, as an \"Achilles' high heel for Rihanna\". Alex Macpherson of The Guardian found Rihanna to be \"ill-suited\" for its dance-pop songs and stated, \"The gimmicky samples and pounding beats bury her personality, and the summery reggae of her first two albums is sorely missed.\" Robert Christgau of MSN Music cited \"Umbrella\" as a \"choice cut\", indicating \"a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money\".", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Girl_Gone_Bad", "title": "Good Girl Gone Bad", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the full name of the man who found the album that had Timbaland produce on it to have ballads that were improvements from the last album?", "query_id": "83ba87f00a38d9e16e00376d604052bf11bada36", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Rodney Dugue"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Rodney Dugue", "answer_start": 1350}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the critic who did not like the lyrics written by Justin Timberlake on the album that got generally favorable reviews?", "query_id": "252c13d4e8881402849a8d1641d56ac1575644ed", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Sal Cinquemani"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Sal Cinquemani", "answer_start": 1594}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the critic who believed \"Umbrella\" was a \"choice cut\" on the album that had an average score of 72?", "query_id": "40dfb7fac7437568e09ea5faa17f92517e2ede17", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Robert Christgau"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Robert Christgau", "answer_start": 1952}]}]}, "be6ea566f72815239691160c92e6c6884b15fb21": {"passage": "Seventeen-year-old identical twin sisters Jane and Roxy Ryan are completely different and never see eye to eye.

Even before he took the post the Philharmonic's autocratic president, Dorothy Chandler, breached his contract by appointing a deputy music director without Solti's approval. Although he admired the chosen deputy, Zubin Mehta, Solti felt he could not have his authority undermined from the outset, and he withdrew from his appointment. He accepted an offer to become musical director of Covent Garden Opera Company, London. When first sounded out about the post he had declined it. After 14 years of experience at Munich and Frankfurt he was uncertain that he wanted a third successive operatic post. Moreover, founded only 15 years earlier, the Covent Garden company was not yet the equal of the best opera houses in Europe. Bruno Walter convinced Solti that it was his duty to take Covent Garden on.The biographer Montague Haltrecht suggests that Solti seized the breach of his Los Angeles contract as a convenient pretext to abandon the Philharmonic in favour of Covent Garden. However, in his memoirs Solti wrote that he wanted the Los Angeles position very much indeed. He originally considered holding both posts in tandem, but later acknowledged that he had had a lucky escape, as he could have done justice to neither post had he attempted to hold both simultaneously.Solti took up the musical directorship of Covent Garden in August 1961. The press gave him a cautious welcome, but there was some concern that under him there might be a drift away from the company's original policy of opera in English. Solti, however, was an advocate of opera in the vernacular, and he promoted the development of British and Commonwealth singers in the company, frequently casting them in his recordings and important productions in preference to overseas artists. He demonstrated his belief in vernacular opera with a triple bill in English of L'heure espagnole, Erwartung and Gianni Schicchi. As the decade went on, however, more and more productions had to be sung in the original language to accommodate international stars.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Solti", "title": "Georg Solti", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What was the last name of the person who had their contract breached?", "query_id": "1b1b578ff94aebc5921661730a9ce1095f37e464", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Solti"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Solti", "answer_start": 8}]}, {"question": "What was the last name of the person who originally considered holding both posts in tandem?", "query_id": "90640bdaf892fe36a5f37961a83da4eaa1b53586", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Solti"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Solti", "answer_start": 1111}]}, {"question": "What was the last name of the person who the press gave a cautious welcome?", "query_id": "6cbdf6aa7b6e39dccb7ddd6620499f9c1fe5acec", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Solti"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Solti", "answer_start": 1619}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person whose contract was breached?

Bono labelled it \"a more meditative album on the theme of pilgrimage\". Provisionally titled Songs of Ascent, it would be a sister release to No Line on the Horizon, similar to Zooropa's relationship to Achtung Baby. In June 2009, Bono said that although nine tracks had been completed, the album would only be released if its quality surpassed that of No Line on the Horizon. A December 2009 report stated that U2 had been working in the studio with the goal of a mid-2010 release. The band revealed that the first single was intended to be \"Every Breaking Wave\".Over time, the album continued to be delayed. In April 2010, U2's manager Paul McGuinness confirmed that the album would not be finished by June, but indicated that a release \"before the end of the year [was] increasingly likely.\" In October 2010, Bono stated that their new album would be produced by Danger Mouse, and that 12 songs had been completed. He also noted that U2 were working on a potential album of club music in the spirit of \"U2's remixes in the 1990s\". Around the same time, McGuinness said the album was slated for an early 2011 release. In February 2011, he said that the album was almost complete and had a tentative release date of May 2011, although he noted that Songs of Ascent was no longer the likely title.

Although Deal performed most of the instruments herself at the 1999 sessions, her sister had some involvement. They recorded \"The She\", \"Forced to Drive\", and \"Too Alive\" in Chicago, with Deal's drum performance on the third track taken from the Texas session.Deal was satisfied with the material recorded up to this point, but realized she would not be able to tour without a band. She returned to New York to look for a backing group in March 2000. After a chance meeting with members of Fear, she invited drummer Andrew Jaimez, bassist Mando Lopez, and guitarist Richard Presley to jam with her at the studio she was renting. Deal wanted to continue playing with these musicians, and so within three months she moved to Fear's hometown Los Angeles. Jaimez, Lopez, and Presley joined the Breeders, and Kelley Deal rejoined the group soon after. About a month after Kim Deal's arrival, Jose Medeles replaced Jaimez, who decided he did not have enough time for the Breeders because of his involvement in other musical projects. The new line-up spent the rest of the year writing and rehearsing.The Breeders returned to Chicago in mid-2001 to continue recording with Albini. \"Little Fury\", \"London Song\", \"Off You\", \"Put on a Side\", \"Full on Idle\", \"T and T\", and \"Huffer\" were recorded in 2001. At some point from 2000 to 2002, the group spent time at the Grandmaster Recording Ltd. studio in Los Angeles. The session at Grandmaster Recording, engineered by Mark Arnold and Andrew Alekel, resulted in \"Son of Three\" and \"Sinister Foxx\". \"Fire the Maid\", a song from these sessions written and sung by Kelley Deal, was performed in concert in 2000 and 2001 but was not included on the album.Kelley Deal has stated that \"Little Fury\" and \"Sinister Foxx\" started as \"just ideas\" by the sisters that turned into full collaborations by the group\u2014all five musicians received songwriting credits on these tracks. Kim Deal is credited as sole songwriter on the remaining ten tracks, although other band members contributed musical ideas as well.During the Title TK sessions, Kim Deal adopted a philosophy she calls \"All Wave\". This approach stipulates that only analog recording may be used, without computer editing. Deal has said that she likes \"interesting mistakes\" in song production, and that her beliefs about recording are \"a reaction ... to everything sounding so straight and clean in most records today\".

The Fame was released on August 19, 2008, reached number one in Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK, and the top five in Australia and the US. Its first two singles, \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\", reached number one in the United States, Australia, Canada and the UK. The latter was also the world's best-selling single of 2009, with 9.8 million copies sold that year, and spent a record 83 weeks on Billboard magazine's Digital Songs chart. Three other singles, \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\", \"LoveGame\" and \"Paparazzi\", were released from the album; the last one reached number one in Germany. Remixed versions of the singles from The Fame, except \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\", were included on Hitmixes in August 2009. At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, The Fame and \"Poker Face\" won Best Dance/Electronica Album and Best Dance Recording, respectively.Following her opening act on The Pussycat Dolls' 2009 Doll Domination Tour in Europe and Oceania, Gaga headlined her worldwide The Fame Ball Tour, which ran from March to September 2009. While traveling the globe, she wrote eight songs for The Fame Monster, a reissue of The Fame. Those new songs were also released as a standalone EP on November 18, 2009. Its first single, \"Bad Romance\", was released one month earlier and went number one in Canada and the UK, and number two in the US, Australia and New Zealand. \"Telephone\", with Beyonc\u00e9, followed as the second single from the EP and became Gaga's fourth UK number one. Its third single was \"Alejandro\", which reached number one in Finland and attracted controversy when its music video was deemed blasphemous by the Catholic League. Both tracks reached the top five in the US. The video for \"Bad Romance\" became the most watched on YouTube in April 2010, and that October, Gaga became the first person with more than one billion combined views. At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, she won eight awards from 13 nominations, including Video of the Year for \"Bad Romance\". She was the most nominated artist for a single year, and the first female to receive two nominations for Video of the Year at the same ceremony. The Fame Monster won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, and \"Bad Romance\" won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Short Form Music Video at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "title": "Lady Gaga", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Which song reached number only in Germany?", "query_id": "f5b3028796f47f3d6cde982d8c2de60de33a105c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Paparazzi"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Paparazzi", "answer_start": 755}]}, {"question": "What award did The Fame win at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards?", "query_id": "f0dfa63bdf2eda5fe7ea36a3a609e7d378ae2d48", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Best Dance/Electronica Album"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Best Dance/Electronica Album", "answer_start": 1036}]}, {"question": "What award did Poker Face win at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards?", "query_id": "8cf5bcc963ac0275209258374dc098cedd43a963", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Best Dance Recording"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Best Dance Recording", "answer_start": 1069}]}, {"question": "What year did The Fame Ball Tour happen?", "query_id": "57e07eefc30b204ed0b7fe319b9fea8498aecc08", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["2009"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "2009", "answer_start": 1285}]}, {"question": "What EP was released on November 18?", "query_id": "83b29ac606480f41c1620fb112a01af6b793b1e6", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The Fame Monster"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The Fame Monster", "answer_start": 1344}]}, {"question": "What was the first release from The Fame Monster?", "query_id": "b5a0c77c4bcd35956d65667caf7a381afbdcf20a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Bad Romance"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Bad Romance", "answer_start": 1480}]}, {"question": "Which song became Gaga's fourth number one song in the UK?", "query_id": "b48f34fd9c1633bea8f193c2df0e80fe71e11dac", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Telephone"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Telephone", "answer_start": 1621}]}, {"question": "On what platform did Gaga become the first person with more than one billion combined views", "query_id": "8e2ea0569ba3b5763ef3d7bc59ec1c69087b041a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["YouTube"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "YouTube", "answer_start": 1992}]}]}, "baf24e1202d8ea10aa02d4bf4ffb22b5ac4cc039": {"passage": "Most of the early Norman castles were built from timber, but by the end of the 11th century a few, including the Tower of London, had been renovated or replaced with stone. Work on the White Tower \u2013 which gives the whole castle its name \u2013 is usually considered to have begun in 1078, however the exact date is uncertain. William made Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, responsible for its construction, although it may not have been completed until after William's death in 1087. The White Tower is the earliest stone keep in England, and was the strongest point of the early castle. It also contained grand accommodation for the king. At the latest, it was probably finished by 1100 when Bishop Ranulf Flambard was imprisoned there. Flambard was loathed by the English for exacting harsh taxes. Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower, he was also the first person to escape from it, using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine. He was held in luxury and permitted servants, but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors. After plying them with drink, when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber, and out of the Tower. The escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 1097 King William II ordered a wall to be built around the Tower of London; it was probably built from stone as a replacement for the timber palisade that arced around the north and west sides of the castle, between the Roman wall and the Thames. The Norman Conquest of London manifested itself not only with a new ruling class, but in the way the city was structured. Land was confiscated and redistributed amongst the Normans, who also brought over hundreds of Jews, for financial reasons. The Jews arrived under the direct protection of the Crown, as a result of which Jewish communities were often found close to castles. The Jews used the Tower as a retreat, when threatened by anti-Jewish violence.The death in 1135 of Henry I left England with a disputed succession; although the king had persuaded his most powerful barons to swear support for the Empress Matilda, just a few days after Henry's death Stephen of Blois arrived from France to lay claim to the throne. The importance of the city and its Tower is marked by the speed at which he secured London. The castle, which had not been used as a royal residence for some time, was usually left in the charge of a Constable, a post held at this time by Geoffrey de Mandeville. As the Tower was considered an impregnable fortress in a strategically important position, possession was highly valued. Mandeville exploited this, selling his allegiance to Matilda after Stephen was captured in 1141 at the Battle of Lincoln. Once her support waned, the following year he resold his loyalty to Stephen. Through his role as Constable of the Tower, Mandeville became \"the richest and most powerful man in England\". When he tried the same ploy again, this time holding secret talks with Matilda, Stephen had him arrested, forced him to cede control of his castles, and replaced him with one of his most loyal supporters. Until then the position had been hereditary, originally held by Geoffrey de Mandeville (a friend of William the Conqueror's and ancestor of the Geoffrey that Stephen and Matilda dealt with), but the position's authority was such that from then on it remained in the hands of an appointee of the monarch. The position was usually given to someone of great importance, who might not always be at the castle due to other duties. Although the Constable was still responsible for maintaining the castle and its garrison, from an early stage he had a subordinate to help with this duty: the Lieutenant of the Tower. Constables also had civic duties relating to the city. Usually they were given control of the city and were responsible for levying taxes, enforcing the law and maintaining order. The creation in 1191 of the position of Lord Mayor of London removed many of the Constable's civic powers, and at times led to friction between the two.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London", "title": "Tower of London", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the full name of the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower?", "query_id": "c08244703fae3982de641f9f045bd300eddf9c36", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Bishop Ranulf Flambard"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Bishop Ranulf Flambard", "answer_start": 684}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who hosted a banquet for his captors on 2 February 1101?", "query_id": "981d7a69a84c76f3d439ce3670436473ce1b38de", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Flambard"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Flambard", "answer_start": 729}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who lowered himself from a secluded chamber, and out of the Tower, after plying his captors with drink?", "query_id": "d4ecd1e52968fcd8e520628908734b8bd1b3e94a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Flambard"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Flambard", "answer_start": 729}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the bishop accused of witchcraft by one contemporary chronicler due to his surprise escape from the Tower?", "query_id": "4d9f684c840f44d1f95feefeaed0e14713672548", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Flambard"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Flambard", "answer_start": 729}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the king who had persuaded his most powerful barons to swear support for the Empress Matilda?", "query_id": "a959f2f5d34c1b0957ca6961735d2ee180312437", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Henry I"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Henry I", "answer_start": 2045}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person who resold his loyalty to Stephen after support for Matilda waned?", "query_id": "5771b8344c1fcf73a3bde863f0f6d5f2ae87f0e6", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Geoffrey de Mandeville"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Geoffrey de Mandeville", "answer_start": 2533}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the Constable whose allegiance was sold to Matilda after Stephen was captured in 1141 at the Battle of Lincoln?", "query_id": "f5370a8a23ab5472330856527541a2c5b7dd1b7c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Geoffrey de Mandeville"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Geoffrey de Mandeville", "answer_start": 2533}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the Empress once whose support waned Mandeville resold his loyalty to Stephen the following year?", "query_id": "276173384be81061b0321f843c496fee0d9aec20", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Matilda"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Matilda", "answer_start": 2731}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person who Stephen had arrested when he tried the same ploy again, this time holding secret talks with Matilda?", "query_id": "5b653961df4b9c5bc2de380490ed3fbcee0a13b6", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Geoffrey de Mandeville"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Geoffrey de Mandeville", "answer_start": 2533}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person who was replaced with one of Stephen's most loyal supporters after being forced to cede control of his castles?", "query_id": "fb0a817bfe94eca7caf429a3cdd36abc20448f26", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Geoffrey de Mandeville"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Geoffrey de Mandeville", "answer_start": 2533}]}]}, "e869084b43c7c3a965f9d6ceb8914d89f296c7de": {"passage": "An elderly veteran visits the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial with his family.

During a discussion over dinner in late 2000, the band members decided they wanted to explore dancehall-style rhythms for their next album. Drawing inspiration from artists such as Bounty Killer, Cutty Ranks, and Mr. Vegas, the band began work on the album in January 2001 by creating beats on Pro Tools at guitarist Tom Dumont's apartment. The group often tried recreating beats from other song files on the computer, which resulted in modified versions of the original rhythms. They worked with producer Philip Steir at Toast Studios in San Francisco during this time, where the beginnings of \"Hey Baby\" emerged. When writing lyrics for previous albums, Stefani typically read works by Sylvia Plath that would make her depressed \"or find different words that inspire me.\" In contrast, for Rock Steady she wrote the lyrics quicker and on the spot to meet the goal of writing a song a day. Many of the demos recorded during these early sessions were used in the final tracks, rather than completely reworking the songs. The band saw this as a way to preserve the \"initial spark\" from when the songs were conceived.The next month, Stefani left Los Angeles for London to visit boyfriend Rossdale, and the band traveled with her to finish recording \"Detective\". There, they worked with Eurythmics member David A. Stewart and wrote the song \"Underneath It All\" in only 10 minutes. In March, No Doubt traveled to Jamaica, staying at the Blue Lagoon in Port Antonio. The band \"spent most of the time swimming and getting sunburned and drinking and smoking and recording a little music\", according to Dumont. The group would often have Red Stripe beers or rum and cokes with jerk food for breakfast; on one occasion, Dumont passed out from heavy drinking while recording a track. They began work in the mid-afternoon and worked into the night, with an after-party following the session. The group collaborated with Sly & Robbie, who produced \"Underneath It All\" and \"Hey Baby\" and brought in dancehall toasters Lady Saw and Bounty Killer, and Steely & Clevie, who produced \"Start the Fire\".", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Steady_(album)", "title": "Rock Steady (album)", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the song that the band finished in London?", "query_id": "3cb441cce3d6ccdafd3381fb9ec88d2453618e8d", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Detective"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Detective", "answer_start": 1400}]}, {"question": "What group did the person who helped write a song for No Doubt in 10 minutes belong to?", "query_id": "277ae1cdac8a896edb539802e72b9597fd8884a4", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Eurythmics"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Eurythmics", "answer_start": 1436}]}, {"question": "What hotel did the band that began working on an album in 2001 stay at while in Jamiaica?", "query_id": "bf47b97fb454caf8446fe64ace3c4cefba93701b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Blue Lagoon"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Blue Lagoon", "answer_start": 1585}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the duo that produced \"Underneath it All\" for the band?", "query_id": "84dba2b7958c99e89eddd7e156abc60a1f653fc4", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Sly & Robbie"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Sly & Robbie", "answer_start": 2061}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the duo that produced \"Start the Fire\" for the band?", "query_id": "bb4feeb4d9eeccb1cb29c0d2aa19fe242d99e254", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Steely & Clevie"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Steely & Clevie", "answer_start": 2189}]}]}, "42183791627be76d523a657088ad9600d2cd9ea6": {"passage": "In 1937, a military facility is on watch behind a two-way mirror as a soldier, smoking marijuana, reveals what he hates about the army while remaining euphoric.

Shortly thereafter, Annie tells the family that she's pregnant, and George begins to mildly panic, insisting he is too young to be a grandfather. He has his assistant make a list of people who are older than him, dyes his hair brown, and decides he and Nina should sell the home their children have grown up in if one more thing goes wrong with it.\nTermites strike the house two weeks later. George puts the house on the market without telling Nina, and sells it to the Habibs. At dinner, after a discussion on whether the baby's last name will be hyphenated or not, George reveals the house has been sold. Nina is livid, as she and George have to be out in 10 days and have no place to go. Having no place to go, the Banks stay at the mansion owned by Bryan's parents. As the MacKenzies are on a cruise in the Caribbean, the Banks have to deal with their vicious Dobermans, much to the chagrin of George, who is still obviously paranoid from a previous mishap with them. Nina begins experiencing symptoms that bring up the concern of menopause. After visiting the doctor the following day, they are given the opposite news: Nina is pregnant, too. \nNot long after, they have a chance meeting with Franck, Annie's wedding planner, who is elated at both women expecting. George switches gears, now believing he is too old to be a father again. His feelings come to a head when he and Nina go to Annie's and Bryan's house to announce their news.

Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \"Symphony of a Thousand\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910.\nThe fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \"middle\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\"Come, Creator Spirit\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes.\nMahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W. Adorno, Robert Simpson and Jonathan Carr found its optimism unconvincing, and considered it artistically and musically inferior to Mahler's other symphonies. Conversely, it has also been compared\u2014by Deryck Cooke\u2014to Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 as a defining human statement for its century.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._8_(Mahler)", "title": "Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the real name of the work that requires huge instrumental and vocal forces?", "query_id": "dfd0fe958b6dc837d3a8ac569c7c8632b113ac9b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "What is the real name of the work that is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers?", "query_id": "608e7ecc6f134440b75ccfb991e5204970688f47", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who did not sanction a nickname for his work?", "query_id": "6c3d5be02e2af0b45d495daa71886e7aa1aaa9c1", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Mahler"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Mahler", "answer_start": 1490}]}, {"question": "What is the nickname of the work that was the last premiered in Mahler's life?", "query_id": "4e921c7243219f5d15e10913d3ad19d24a422d10", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Symphony of a Thousand"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Symphony of a Thousand", "answer_start": 214}]}, {"question": "What is the real name of the work that was composed at Maiernigg?", "query_id": "b00454f5c58b2b450e3c4c6131670694d0779472", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "What is the real name of the work that was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance?", "query_id": "91e9121a97403067a9d5e713c7caf98fd65bc5f6", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who conducted the Munich Philharmonic in Munich on September 12, 1910?", "query_id": "f34f65eaeb529e4949bdb230693c5123d97d93be", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Mahler"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Mahler", "answer_start": 1490}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person whose \"middle\" compositional period was after 1901?", "query_id": "470570aaff7d9a1b62fadb2ecf29de37c4275c2a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Mahler"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Mahler", "answer_start": 1490}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who produced three purely instrumental symphonies after a change in direction?", "query_id": "4bcfa88f67a430a999e374437244123746ab8385", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Mahler"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Mahler", "answer_start": 1490}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit?", "query_id": "8980306403feb5a60a4d0b93417e76feb61e0292", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Mahler"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Mahler", "answer_start": 1490}]}]}, "4a8b3c6b95ec39c008043eff327077d4b607a82f": {"passage": "By far the most significant factor that led to the princes' decision to accede to India was the policy of the Congress and, in particular, of Patel and Menon. The Congress' stated position was that the princely states were not sovereign entities, and as such could not opt to be independent notwithstanding the end of paramountcy. The princely states must therefore accede to either India or Pakistan. In July 1946, Nehru pointedly observed that no princely state could prevail militarily against the army of independent India. In January 1947, he said that independent India would not accept the divine right of kings, and in May 1947, he declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state. Other Congress leaders, such as C. Rajagopalachari, argued that as paramountcy \"came into being as a fact and not by agreement\", it would necessarily pass to the government of independent India, as the successor of the British.Patel and Menon, who were charged with the actual job of negotiating with the princes, took a more conciliatory approach than Nehru. The official policy statement of the Government of India made by Patel on 5 July 1947 made no threats. Instead, it emphasised the unity of India and the common interests of the princes and independent India, reassured them about the Congress' intentions, and invited them to join independent India \"to make laws sitting together as friends than to make treaties as aliens\". He reiterated that the States Department would not attempt to establish a relationship of domination over the princely states.

The neocortex of many species of whale is home to elongated spindle neurons that, prior to 2007, were known only in hominids. In humans, these cells are involved in social conduct, emotions,  judgement, and theory of mind. Whale spindle neurons are found in areas of the brain that are homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting that they perform a similar function.\nBrain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the \u2154 or \u00be exponent of the body mass. Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalisation quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. Sperm whales have the largest brain mass of any animal on earth, averaging 8,000 cubic centimetres (490 in3) and 7.8 kilograms (17 lb) in mature males, in comparison to the average human brain which averages 1,450 cubic centimetres (88 in3) in mature males. The brain to body mass ratio in some odontocetes, such as belugas and narwhals, is second only to humans.Small whales are known to engage in complex play behaviour, which includes such things as producing stable underwater toroidal air-core vortex rings or \"bubble rings\". There are two main methods of bubble ring production: rapid puffing of a burst of air into the water and allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring, or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into the helical vortex currents thus formed. They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex-rings, so that they burst into many separate bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface. Some believe this is a means of communication. Whales are also known to produce bubble-nets for the purpose of foraging.\nLarger whales are also thought, to some degree, to engage in play. The southern right whale, for example, elevates their tail fluke above the water, remaining in the same position for a considerable amount of time. This is known as \"sailing\". It appears to be a form of play and is most commonly seen off the coast of Argentina and South Africa.

He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London. It was the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation; Vaughan Williams's contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune, and a new setting of \"O taste and see\" from Psalm 34, performed at the service in Westminster Abbey.\nHaving returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as \"like a musical state occasion\".Of Vaughan Williams's works from the 1950s, Grove makes particular mention of Three Shakespeare Songs (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata Hodie (1953\u20131954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the Ten Blake Songs (1957) for voice and oboe, \"a masterpiece of economy and precision\". Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, Thomas the Rhymer. The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh\u2014officially unnumbered, and titled Sinfonia antartica\u2014divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic, and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The Eighth, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra under the dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli. The Ninth, premiered at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent in April 1958, puzzled critics with its sombre, questing tone, and did not immediately achieve the recognition it later gained.Having been in excellent health, Vaughan Williams died suddenly in the early hours of 26 August 1958 at Hanover Terrace, aged 85. Two days later, after a private funeral at Golders Green, he was cremated.

This courtyard has heavy-banded channelled rustication that has been widely copied, notably for the Parisian palais of Maria de' Medici, the Luxembourg. In the principal fa\u00e7ade Ammanati also created the finestre inginocchiate (\"kneeling\" windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a prie-dieu, a device of Michelangelo's), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558\u201370, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the piano nobile, and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement.  On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a grotto, called the \"grotto of Moses\" on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it. On the terrace above it, level with the piano nobile windows, Ammanati constructed a fountain centered on the axis; it was later replaced by the Fontana del Carciofo (\"Fountain of the Artichoke\"), designed by Giambologna's former assistant, Francesco Susini, and completed in 1641.In 1616, a competition was held to design extensions to the principal urban fa\u00e7ade by three bays at either end. Giulio Parigi won the commission; work on the north side began in 1618, and on the south side in 1631 by Alfonso Parigi.  During the 18th century, two perpendicular wings were constructed by the architect Giuseppe Ruggeri to enhance and stress the widening of via Romana, which creates a piazza centered on the fa\u00e7ade, the prototype of the cour d'honneur that was copied in France.  Sporadic lesser additions and alterations were made for many years thereafter under other rulers and architects.To one side of the Gardens is the bizarre grotto designed by Bernardo Buontalenti. The lower fa\u00e7ade was begun by Vasari  but the architecture of the upper storey is subverted by \"dripping\" pumice stalactites with the Medici coat of arms at the centre. The interior is similarly poised between architecture and nature; the first chamber has copies of Michelangelo's four unfinished slaves emerging from the corners which seem to carry the vault with an open oculus at its centre and painted as a rustic bower with animals, figures and vegetation. Figures, animals and trees made of stucco and rough pumice adorn the lower walls. A short passage leads to a small second chamber and to a third which has a central fountain with Giambologna's Venus in the centre of the basin, peering fearfully over her shoulder at the four satyrs spitting jets of water at her from the edge.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Pitti", "title": "Palazzo Pitti", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the character who had four satyrs spitting jets of water at her?", "query_id": "9bde5fa14242bb3fa8c0a9850dff6185b04476c2", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Venus"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Venus", "answer_start": 2667}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the person that is made into a statue in the grotto?", "query_id": "e79aba27100da5cb1a9cccb49564ba3c29756f7c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Moses"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Moses", "answer_start": 981}]}, {"question": "What is the terrace with the fountain constructed above?", "query_id": "12204db06eeb47372e44ab94d9a9b4e72f7db9a9", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["\"grotto of Moses\""]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "\"grotto of Moses\"", "answer_start": 970}]}]}, "2aab553064b76dca3625bedb8b0607b33cde3420": {"passage": "In the year 2074, the cybernetics market is dominated by two rival companies: USA's Pinwheel Robotics and Japan's Kobayashi Electronics.

Dubbed the \"King of Pop\", he is widely regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest entertainers of all time. He was also known for his unorthodox lifestyle, residing in a private amusement park he called Neverland Ranch, and often becoming the focus of tabloid scrutiny. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. \nThe eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. He began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records, and in the early 1980s, became a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those for \"Beat It\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"Thriller\" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. Their popularity helped bring the television channel MTV to fame. Bad (1987) was the first album to produce five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles. He continued to innovate throughout the 1990s with videos such as \"Black or White\" and \"Scream\", and forged a reputation as a touring artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized complicated dance techniques such as the robot and the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His sound and style have influenced artists of various genres.\nJackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide; Thriller is the best-selling album of all time, with estimated sales of 66 million copies worldwide. His other albums, including Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory (1995), also rank among the world's best-selling. He won hundreds of awards (more than any other artist in the history of popular music), has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, and is the only pop or rock artist to have been inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame.

Since the blacksmith has no gun, though, Sean can't shoot him because the Kid lives by a code of ethics that prevents him from killing unarmed men.\nWhen she witnesses this, Jane Taylor, one of the townsfolk, says the Kid can have her broken gun (to fix and give to Jack) if he builds her a windmill. Sean proceeds to go with her and stays in a sod house at her farm, alternately working on the windmill and repairing the gun. After a few days, however, the Kid begins to develop feelings toward Jane while also becoming friends with the townsfolk.\nIn the meantime, a roaming band of American bounty hunters crosses into Canada and heads for the town to claim the price on Sean's head.

Subsequent indigenous cultures, the Sobaipuri of the Tucson Basin and the Tohono O'odham to the west, may be descendants of the Hohokam, though the evidence is inconclusive.Spanish explorers first entered Arizona in 1539\u201340. Non-native settlement of the region near the park did not occur until 1692 with the founding of San Xavier Mission along the Santa Cruz River, which flowed through Tucson. In 1775, the Spaniards built Presidio San Agust\u00edn del Tucs\u00f3n, a military fort in what was then part of New Spain, in part to protect against raids by Apaches.The lands that eventually would become Saguaro National Park remained relatively free of development until the mid-19th century, after Arizona had become part of the United States. After passage of the Homestead Act of 1862, the arrival of the railroad in 1880, and the end of the Apache Wars in 1886, homesteaders and ranchers established themselves in the Tucson and Rincon Mountains, and miners sought silver, copper, and other valuable ores and minerals. Mining in the park continued intermittently through 1942, while ranching on private in-holdings within the park continued until the mid-1970s.The defunct Loma Verde Mine, which is still visible in the Rincon Mountain District, produced a small amount of copper and gold between 1897 and 1907. Mining of igneous rock at 149 sites in the Tucson Mountain District sometimes produced ores of modest value in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The most successful, the Copper King Mine (later renamed the Mile Wide Mine), yielded 34,000 tons of copper, gold, lead, zinc, and molybdenum ores, mostly during the war years of 1917, 1918, and 1941; it closed permanently in 1942 when it became unprofitable.Ranchers grazed thousands of cattle on public land that would later become part of the park, and homesteaders farmed and ranched at the base of the Rincons, filing homestead applications from the 1890s through 1930. The remains of the former Freeman Homestead, established in 1929, lie along a nature trail in the Rincon Mountain District. The homestead is on the Arizona State Register of Historic Places. Manning Cabin, built in 1905 as a summer retreat for Levi Manning, a wealthy businessman and one-term mayor of Tucson, is part of the infrastructure at Manning Camp near Mica Mountain. Modified and restored after falling into disrepair, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Cultural resources in the park include more than 450 archeological sites and more than 60 historic structures.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saguaro_National_Park", "title": "Saguaro National Park", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the original name of the mine located in the land occupied by in the past by the Hohokam that closed permanently in 1942 when it became unprofitable?", "query_id": "1deb3a4e41b27476e789a8772d0f2f89ad59c1f7", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Copper King Mine"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Copper King Mine", "answer_start": 1886}]}, {"question": "What is the second name of the mine located in the land occupied by in the past by the Hohokam that closed permanently in 1942 when it became unprofitable?

This event was commemorated by the construction in 1730 of the obelisk, 80 feet (24 m) in height, standing on the highest point in the park. It is located over half a mile to the south and on axis with the centre of the house. An avenue of trees stretches over a mile south of the obelisk. Thousands of trees were planted on what had been windswept land; by 1770 the park covered 1,500 acres (6.1 km2). Other garden buildings designed by Kent are, near the far end of the avenue the Triumphal Arch, designed in 1739 but only completed in 1752 and the domed doric temple (1730\u20131735) in the woods near the obelisk. Above the main entrance to the house within the Marble Hall is this inscription:\nTHIS SEAT, on an open barren Estate\nWas planned, planted, built, decorated.\nAnd inhabited the middle of the XVIIIth Century\nBy THO's COKE EARL of LEICESTER\nUnder Coke of Norfolk, the great-nephew and heir of the builder, extensive improvements were made to the park and by his death in 1842 it had grown to its present extent of over 3,000 acres (12 km2). As well as planting over a million trees on the estate Coke employed the architect Samuel Wyatt to design over a number of buildings, including a series of farm buildings and farmhouses in a simplified neo-classical style and, in the 1780s, the new walled kitchen gardens covering 6 acres (24,000 m2). The gardens stand to the west of the lake and include: A fig house, a peach house, a vinery, and other greenhouses. Wyatt's designs culminated in c. 1790 with the Great Barn, located in the park half a mile south-east of the obelisk. The cost of each farm was in the region of \u00a31,500 to \u00a32,600: Lodge Farm, Castle Acre, cost \u00a32,604 6s. 5d. in 1797\u20131800. The lake to the west of the house, originally a marshy inlet or creek off the North Sea, was created in 1801\u20131803 by the landscape gardener William Eames.\nAfter his death, Coke was commemorated by the Coke Monument, designed by William Donthorne and erected in 1845\u20131848 at a cost to the tenants of the estate of \u00a34,000. The monument consists of a Corinthian column 120 feet (37 m) high, surmounted by a drum supporting a wheatsheaf and a plinth decorated with bas-reliefs carved by John Henning, Jr. The corners of the plinth support sculptures of an ox, sheep, plough and seed-drill. Coke's work to increase farm yields had resulted in the rental income of the estate rising between 1776 and 1816 from \u00a32,200 to \u00a320,000, and had considerable influence on agricultural methods in Britain.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holkham_Hall", "title": "Holkham Hall", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the first name of the person who designed garden buildings near the far end of the avenue?", "query_id": "43de76056d7541ddd8319c8bd9d1d13341cc8ebf", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["William"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "William", "answer_start": 23}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of Coke of Norfolk's great-uncle?", "query_id": "bc4fb4d78c4a07d00c25c9c35ca1838353318a0f", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["THO's COKE EARL of LEICESTER"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "THO's COKE EARL of LEICESTER", "answer_start": 936}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person whose designs culminated in c. 1790 with the Great Barn?", "query_id": "cdad3bba4e82d6d58b0b8cb46a2c9e70a7cefa5f", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Samuel"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Samuel", "answer_start": 1248}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person after whose death was commemorated by a monument?

They had three daughters, Catherine Grace (b. 1856), Edith Marcon Vergence (b. 1859), and Helen Beatruc (b. 1861).In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to Balaklava, Crimea, where they took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton's departure. Beato was ostensibly Robertson's assistant, however the unpredictable conditions of a war-zone forced Beato to assume a more active role. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction and death. They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855, producing about 60 images. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.In February 1858 Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859.

Scholars appreciated Cowper's poetry somewhat more than Newton's plaintive and plain language driven from his forceful personality. The most prevalent themes in the verses written by Newton in Olney Hymns are faith in salvation, wonder at God's grace, his love for Jesus, and his cheerful exclamations of the joy he found in his faith. As a reflection of Newton's connection to his parishioners, he wrote many of the hymns in first person, admitting his own experience with sin. Bruce Hindmarsh in Sing Them Over Again To Me: Hymns and Hymnbooks in America considers \"Amazing Grace\" an excellent example of Newton's testimonial style afforded by the use of this perspective. Several of Newton's hymns were recognised as great work (\"Amazing Grace\" was not among them) while others seem to have been included to fill in when Cowper was unable to write. Jonathan Aitken calls Newton, specifically referring to \"Amazing Grace\", an \"unashamedly middlebrow lyricist writing for a lowbrow congregation\", noting that only twenty-one of the nearly 150 words used in all six verses have more than one syllable.William Phipps in the Anglican Theological Review and author James Basker have interpreted the first stanza of \"Amazing Grace\" as evidence of Newton's realisation that his participation in the slave trade was his wretchedness, perhaps representing a wider common understanding of Newton's motivations. Newton joined forces with a young man named William Wilberforce, the British Member of Parliament who led the Parliamentarian campaign to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire, culminating in the Slave Trade Act 1807. However, Newton became an ardent and outspoken abolitionist after he left Olney in the 1780s; he never connected the construction of the hymn that became \"Amazing Grace\" to anti-slavery sentiments. The lyrics in Olney Hymns were arranged by their association to the Biblical verses that would be used by Newton and Cowper in their prayer meetings and did not address any political objective. For Newton, the beginning of the year was a time to reflect on one's spiritual progress. At the same time he completed a diary \u2013  which has since been lost \u2013  that he had begun 17 years before, two years after he quit sailing.

The number 1293 was also restored to the engine.  In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton. Ohio Central Railroad System purchased it in 1996, and it underwent a 13-month restoration.

The new number remained on the locomotive from 1966 until 1973, when its former number was restored.  The locomotive was leased to the Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan from 1970 to 1971.

In 1734, the first ballet was presented; a year later Handel's first season of operas began. Many of his operas and oratorios were specifically written for Covent Garden and had their premi\u00e8res here.

In worsening weather, Dorian improvised a rough sea anchor, which enabled the boat to ride the waves through the night and following day without being swamped.  In the late afternoon of September 28 they sighted a distant sail, which proved to be the Canadian bark Huron, bound for Quebec.  As they rowed towards their rescuer, they passed Peter McCabe, still clinging to the makeshift raft, the only one of its 72 occupants to have survived the night; he, too was taken on board Huron.  McCabe later recalled that he thought he was within ten minutes of death when he was rescued.On the following day Huron encountered another sailing ship, the Lebanon, heading for New York. Dorian, the five passengers and twelve of the crew chose to transfer to Lebanon. The other crewmen, possibly anticipating a hostile reception in their home port, chose to remain with Huron and proceed to Quebec, where she arrived on October 13.The ordeal of Captain Luce, and others who survived on assorted wreckage, lasted for two days. Around noon on September 29, the sailing ship Cambria, out of Glasgow and heading for Quebec, spotted Fran\u00e7ois Jassonet, the Vesta fisherman who had been rescued by the Arctic after the collision. In the following few hours, Cambria picked up nine more survivors; these included Luce and two companions, the only survivors of the eleven who had found refuge on the remains of the paddlebox.  The last to be picked up by Cambria was James Smith, a businessman from Scotland, who had survived on a raft constructed from planking and a tin-lined wicker basket. He had seen at least one ship pass in the distance during his ordeal, and had almost given up hope when Cambria arrived. Once satisfied there were no further survivors in the area, Cambria continued its journey to Quebec. Luce spent much of the voyage preparing a report of the disaster, ready to wire to Edward Collins in New York as soon as he reached land.  Cambria arrived in Quebec on October 13, a few hours after Huron.The fates of three of Arctic's lifeboats are unknown: the starboard quarter boat in which Gourlay left to assist Vesta just after the collision; the port guard boat, launched under the control of the quartermaster; and the forward deck boat, appropriated by Rogers and his associates. No trace of the occupants of these boats was ever found. In mid-November 1854, Gourlay's empty boat was picked up by the schooner Lily Dale, in good condition and with its oars still inside.

The settlement, known as the Hellenistic settlement, had residences expanding to the wadi's northern bank during the first century. Although the city's walls originally enclosed an extensive area on both banks of the wadi, the walls rebuilt during Aurelian's reign surrounded only the northern-bank section. Most of the city's monumental projects were built on the wadi's northern bank, among them is the Temple of Bel, on a tell which was the site of an earlier temple (known as the Hellenistic temple). However, excavation supports the theory that the tell was originally located on the southern bank, and the wadi was diverted south of the tell to incorporate the temple into Palmyra's late first and early second century urban organization on the north bank.Also north of the wadi was the Great Colonnade, Palmyra's 1.1-kilometre-long (0.68 mi) main street, which extended from the Temple of Bel in the east, to the Funerary Temple no.86 in the city's western part. It had a monumental arch in its eastern section, and a tetrapylon stands in the center. The Baths of Diocletian, built on the ruins of an earlier building which might have been the royal palace, were on the left side of the colonnade. Nearby were residences, the Temple of Baalshamin, and the Byzantine churches, which include \"Basilica IV\", Palmyra's largest church. The church is dated to the Justinian age, its columns are estimated to be 7 metres (23 ft) high, and its base measured 27.5 by 47.5 metres (90 by 156 ft).The Temple of Nabu and the Roman theater were built on the colonnade's southern side. Behind the theater were a small senate building and the large Agora, with the remains of a triclinium (banquet room) and the Tariff Court.

Copper prices rose to 24 cents a pound in 1929, and United Verde and UVX operated at near capacity. Wages rose, consumers spent, and the town's businesses\u2014including five automobile dealerships\u2014prospered. United Verde, seeking stable labor relations, added disability and life insurance benefits for its workers and built a baseball field, tennis courts, swimming pools, and a public park in Jerome. Both companies donated to the Jerome Public Library and helped finance projects for the town's schools, churches, and hospitals.In 1930, after the start of the Great Depression, the price of copper fell to 14 cents a pound. In response, United Verde began reducing its work force; UVX operated at a loss, and the third big mine, Verde Central, closed completely. The price of copper fell further in 1932 to 5 cents a pound, leading to layoffs, temporary shut-downs, and wage reductions in the Verde District. In 1935, the Clark family sold United Verde to Phelps Dodge, and in 1938 UVX went out of business.\nMeanwhile, a subsidence problem that had irreparably damaged at least 10 downtown buildings by 1928 worsened through the 1930s. Dozens of buildings, including the post office and jail, were lost as the earth beneath them sank away. Contributing causes were geologic faulting in the area, blast vibrations from the mines, and erosion that may have been exacerbated by vegetation-killing smelter smoke.Mining continued at a reduced level in the Verde District until 1953, when Phelps Dodge shut down the United Verde Mine and related operations. Jerome's population subsequently fell below 100. To prevent the town from disappearing completely, its remaining residents turned to tourism and retail sales.

Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London.\nNumerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Vel\u00e1zquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Vel\u00e1zquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Vel\u00e1zquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rokeby_Venus", "title": "Rokeby Venus", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the person that has a son named Cupid?", "query_id": "5bb5bd95abbfbfa8a2c57478852339720d9be32c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Venus"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Venus", "answer_start": 318}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the artist that had his painting hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813?", "query_id": "7b415094c469ef051220e0dba1055fd1f1fae553", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Diego Vel\u00e1zquez"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Diego Vel\u00e1zquez", "answer_start": 135}]}, {"question": "What year was the Rokeby Venus moved to England?", "query_id": "3797d51aa1a7370509c7182e02f5adce7d77bab6", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["1813"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "1813", "answer_start": 1603}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the person that badly destroyed the Rokeby Venus?", "query_id": "21ad5cd71108cc5d200a0c1c554321ceab200464", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Mary Richardson"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Mary Richardson", "answer_start": 1848}]}, {"question": "In what year was the Rokeby Venus badly destroyed?", "query_id": "6afb72baf98a76316f5c37c34c650b8fcf4772bb", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["1914"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "1914", "answer_start": 1824}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who cited numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque as sources of inspiration?", "query_id": "d58c892ab27c2dee979ec0db10266f1d157822e4", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Diego"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Diego", "answer_start": 135}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror?", "query_id": "8dc65ad4ef1cf371985b613e319fe3b90410fe08", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Diego"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Diego", "answer_start": 135}]}, {"question": "Who is often described as looking at herself on the mirror in the work?", "query_id": "2da55c21dc08c30812d89c88583ff9b377502a90", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Venus"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Venus", "answer_start": 318}]}, {"question": "Whose face is reflected in the viewers direction?", "query_id": "ee094e7d6cdaf7af63b21b06a824dd3149d7d5b0", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Venus"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Venus", "answer_start": 1057}]}, {"question": "What was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition?", "query_id": "9cf07efefbdd492d91beb5a5c088c10ea575409a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["seventeenth-century Spanish art"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "seventeenth-century Spanish art", "answer_start": 1354}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the artist whose painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813?", "query_id": "806c2898083a9ff80db77f9db148c1cdf4988594", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Diego"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Diego", "answer_start": 135}]}, {"question": "What did Mary Richardson attack and damage?", "query_id": "551a35d0980ea7811b3045a189fb6849c0fbd300", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The Rokeby Venus"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The Rokeby Venus", "answer_start": 0}]}]}, "df94e451feb0f5465b54b190f498cc467b286d14": {"passage": "The story begins in the 1960s with three inmates in a New York prison \u2014 Earl, Rocco, and Carlito \u2014 controlling their criminal empire within their cell.

In Kaifeng, he established a strong central government over the empire. The establishment of this capital marked the start of the Northern Song period. He ensured administrative stability by promoting the civil service examination system of drafting state bureaucrats by skill and merit (instead of aristocratic or military position) and promoted projects that ensured efficiency in communication throughout the empire. In one such project, cartographers created detailed maps of each province and city that were then collected in a large atlas. Emperor Taizu also promoted groundbreaking scientific and technological innovations by supporting such works as the astronomical clock tower designed and built by the engineer Zhang Sixun.The Song court maintained diplomatic relations with Chola India, the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt, Srivijaya, the Kara-Khanid Khanate of Central Asia, the Goryeo kingdom in Korea, and other countries that were also trade partners with Japan. Chinese records even mention an embassy from the ruler of \"Fu lin\" (\u62c2\u83fb, i.e. the Byzantine Empire), Michael VII Doukas, and its arrival in 1081. However, China's closest neighbouring states had the greatest impact on its domestic and foreign policy. From its inception under Taizu, the Song dynasty alternated between warfare and diplomacy with the ethnic Khitans of the Liao dynasty in the northeast and with the Tanguts of the Western Xia in the northwest. The Song dynasty used military force in an attempt to quell the Liao dynasty and to recapture the Sixteen Prefectures, a territory under Khitan control since 938 that was traditionally considered to be part of China proper (Most parts of today's Beijing and Tianjin). Song forces were repulsed by the Liao forces, who engaged in aggressive yearly campaigns into Northern Song territory until 1005, when the signing of the Shanyuan Treaty ended these northern border clashes.

He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, and made a partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, with whom he had decided he was, after all, in love.In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively. Another preoccupation was an increasing fascination with magical and occult practices, an interest first awakened during his Oxford year and revived in Cornwall. A letter to Robert Nichols indicates that at this time he was  \"tamper[ing] ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic\". To his former tutor Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused about books \"full of the most astounding wisdom and illumination\"; these works included Eliphas Levi's History of Transcendental Magic, which includes procedures for the invocation of demons. These diversions did not prevent Heseltine from participating in Dublin's cultural life. He met W.B. Yeats, a fellow-enthusiast for the occult, and briefly considered writing an opera based on the 9th-century Celtic folk-tale of Liadain and Curithir. The composer Denis ApIvor has indicated that Heseltine's obsession with the occult was eventually replaced by his studies in religious philosophies, to which he was drawn through membership of a theosophist group in Dublin. Heseltine's interest in this field had originally been aroused by Kaikhosru Sorabji, the composer who had introduced him to the music of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k.On 12 May 1918 Heseltine delivered a well-received illustrated lecture, \"What Music Is\", at Dublin's Abbey Theatre, which included musical excerpts from Bart\u00f3k, the French composer Paul Ladmirault, and Van Dieren. Heseltine's championing of Van Dieren's music led in August 1918 to a vituperative war of words with the music publisher Winthrop Rogers, over the latter's rejection of several Van Dieren compositions. This dispute stimulated Heseltine's own creative powers, and in his final two weeks in Ireland he wrote ten songs, which later critics have considered  to be  among his finest work.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Warlock", "title": "Peter Warlock", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the last name of the composer who indicated that the man who moved to Ireland to forestall conscription interest in the occult turned into studies in religious philosophies?", "query_id": "f3097bb3cbd6e077de0e75316ab351c00a6063e5", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["ApIvor"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "ApIvor", "answer_start": 1417}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the composer that aroused religious philosophy interest in the man who was fascinated with Celtic languages?", "query_id": "ed91aca5f1fc713ed9c24fd43fec168cd7a669ce", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Sorabji"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Sorabji", "answer_start": 1698}]}]}, "8beff3f56f8450e410681258dc99b03fb2774dae": {"passage": "On December 4, 1971, Zappa suffered his first of two serious setbacks. While performing at Casino de Montreux in Switzerland, the Mothers' equipment was destroyed when a flare set off by an audience member started a fire that burned down the casino. Immortalized in Deep Purple's song \"Smoke on the Water\", the event and immediate aftermath can be heard on the bootleg album Swiss Cheese/Fire, released legally as part of Zappa's Beat the Boots II compilation. After losing $50,000 (equivalent to $309,000 in 2018) worth of equipment and a week's break, the Mothers played at the Rainbow Theatre, London, with rented gear. During the encore, an audience member jealous because of his girlfriend's infatuation with Zappa pushed him off the stage and into the concrete-floored orchestra pit. The band thought Zappa had been killed\u2014he had suffered serious fractures, head trauma and injuries to his back, leg, and neck, as well as a crushed larynx, which ultimately caused his voice to drop a third after healing.This attack resulted in an extended period of wheelchair confinement, making touring impossible for over half a year. Upon return to the stage in September 1972, Zappa was still wearing a leg brace, had a noticeable limp and could not stand for very long while on stage. Zappa noted that one leg healed \"shorter than the other\" (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs \"Zomby Woof\" and \"Dancin' Fool\"), resulting in chronic back pain. Meanwhile, the Mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of Flo and Eddie's band as they set out on their own.\nDuring 1971\u201372 Zappa released two strongly jazz-oriented solo LPs, Waka/Jawaka and The Grand Wazoo, which were recorded during the forced layoff from concert touring, using floating line-ups of session players and Mothers alumni. Musically, the albums were akin to Hot Rats, in that they featured extended instrumental tracks with extended soloing. Zappa began touring again in late 1972. His first effort was a series of concerts in September 1972 with a 20-piece big band referred to as the Grand Wazoo. This was followed by a scaled-down version known as the Petit Wazoo that toured the U.S. for five weeks from October to December 1972.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zappa", "title": "Frank Zappa", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What are the specific names of the two albums that were musically akin to Hot Rats?", "query_id": "c6a46898898c9344d46150cd4288b342cc5aff43", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Waka/Jawaka", "The Grand Wazoo"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Waka/Jawaka", "answer_start": 1646}, {"text": "The Grand Wazoo", "answer_start": 1662}]}, {"question": "What are the specific names of the two albums that featured extended instrumental tracks with extended soloing?", "query_id": "7b436d53e5567160152ebee06365e49271f9db53", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Waka/Jawaka", "The Grand Wazoo"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Waka/Jawaka", "answer_start": 1646}, {"text": "The Grand Wazoo", "answer_start": 1662}]}]}, "c3bb6b5f45b06b454a99be9b685f695ba2a61aa1": {"passage": "Elliot Hopper is a workaholic widower who is about to land the deal of a lifetime at work, which he hopes will win him a promotion and a company car.

These organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the Park: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest.Desert conditions persist on canyon bottoms and rocky ledges away from perennial streams. Sagebrush, prickly pear cactus, and rabbitbrush, along with sacred datura and Indian paintbrush, are common. Utah penstemon and golden aster can also be found. Milkvetch and prince's plume are found in pockets of selenium-rich soils.Common daytime animals include mule deer, rock squirrels, pinyon jays, and whiptail and collared lizards. Desert cottontails, jackrabbits, and Merriam's kangaroo rats come out at night. Cougars, bobcats, coyotes, badgers, gray foxes, and ring-tail cats are the top predators.Cooler conditions persist at mid-elevation slopes, from 3,900 to 5,500 feet (1,200 to 1,700 m). Stunted forests of pinyon pine and juniper coexist here with manzanita shrubs, cliffrose, serviceberry, scrub oak, and yucca.  Stands of ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, manzanita and aspen populate the mesas and cliffs above 6,000 feet (1,800 m).\nGolden eagles, red-tailed hawks, peregrine falcons, and white-throated swifts can be seen in the area.Desert bighorn sheep were reintroduced in the park in 1973. California condors were reintroduced in the Arizona Strip and in 2014 the first successful breeding of condors in the park was confirmed. Nineteen species of bat also live in the area.Boxelder, Fremont cottonwood, maple, and willow dominate riparian plant communities.

Ludwig Sr. and William F. Ludwig Jr. On 29 November 2002 (the first anniversary of Harrison's death), he performed \"Photograph\" and a cover of Carl Perkins' \"Honey Don't\" at the Concert for George held in the Royal Albert Hall, London. Early the following year, he released the album Ringo Rama, which contained a song he co-wrote as a tribute to Harrison, \"Never Without You\". Also in 2003, he formed Pumkinhead Records with All-Starr Band member Mark Hudson. The label was not prolific, but their first signing was Liam Lynch, who produced a 2003 LP entitled Fake Songs.Starr served as an honorary Santa Tracker and voice-over personality in 2003 and 2004 during the London stop in Father Christmas's annual Christmas Eve journey, as depicted in the annual NORAD tracks Santa program. According to NORAD officials, he was \"a Starr in the east\" who helped guide North American Aerospace Defense Command's Santa-tracking tradition.\nHis 2005 release Choose Love eschewed the star-guests approach of his last two studio albums but failed to chart in the UK or the US. That same year, Liverpool's City Council announced plans to demolish Starr's birthplace, 9 Madryn Street, stating that it had \"no historical significance\". The LCC later announced that the building would be taken apart brick by brick and preserved.Starr released the album Liverpool 8 in January 2008, coinciding with the start of Liverpool's year as the European Capital of Culture. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings, but after a falling out with Starr, he was replaced by David A. Stewart. Starr performed the title track at the opening ceremony for Liverpool's appointment, but thereafter attracted controversy over his seemingly unflattering comments about his city of birth. Later that year, he was the object of further criticism in the press for posting a video on his website in which he harangued fans and autograph hunters for sending him items to sign.In April 2009, he reunited with McCartney at the David Lynch Foundation's \"Change Begins Within\" benefit concert, held at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Having played his own set beforehand, Starr joined McCartney for the finale and performed \"With a Little Help from My Friends\", among other songs. Starr also appeared on-stage during Microsoft's June 2009 E3 press conference with Yoko Ono, McCartney and Olivia Harrison to promote The Beatles: Rock Band video game.

Education writer Gary Spruce refers to hundreds of similar cases, and cites that of William Crotch of Norwich who in 1778, at the age of three, was giving organ recitals. British scholar Jane O'Connor explains the 18th century fascination with prodigies as \"the realisation of the potential entertainment and fiscal value of an individual child who was in some way extraordinary\". Other childhood contemporaries of Mozart included the violinist and composer Thomas Linley, born the same year as Wolfgang, and the organist prodigy Joseph Siegmund Bachmann. Mozart eventually became recognised among prodigies as the future standard for early success and promise.Of seven children born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy. The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography. Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians. When Nannerl was seven her father began to teach her to play the harpsichord, with Wolfgang looking on; according to Nannerl's own account \"the boy immediately showed his extraordinary, God-given talent.

Believing the police have stopped the elevator, the thieves take their fellow passengers hostage to negotiate an escape.

Katerina is sent to stand guard over Richie and the remainder of the hostages, while Sonya takes Yuri to a chamber where he is to sacrificed by a wild man in armor named Alex.

Kastor is shown training and recovering from an injury in Mammoth Lakes, California, while Njenga's life as a sponsored runner in Tokyo is profiled.\nThe rest of the runners featured live in Chicago. Ryan Bradley and Lori O'Connor are both married young professionals; Bradley is a veteran marathoner who hopes to earn a qualifying time for the Boston Marathon, and O'Connor is running her first marathon.  She finds it humorous when colleagues ask if she expects to win.  Jerry Meyers is a jovial 70-year-old who claims to run marathons for the T-shirt.  Leah Caille is a new runner that took up the sport to help recover from an emotional divorce.\nWhile preparing for the race, Bradley suffers a knee injury and is unable to compete. He is clearly upset by this, and takes out his frustration by going for a long bike ride. O'Connor and Caille go through the new experience of the long training sessions necessary for a marathoner.

The drawing has a loosely sketched background and shows, from left to right: an unidentified bishop saint with mitre and crosier making a blessing gesture; a narrow gap with a few wavy vertical lines suggesting a start at the outline of a further kneeling figure; a barefoot bearded figure in a rough robe identified as Saint John the Baptist; a seated Virgin holding on her lap the Christ Child who leans to the right, looking at a book; and holding the book, a kneeling beardless male identified as John the Evangelist. The drawing stops at the end of John's robe, at about the point on the London panel where Joseph's walking stick meets John and the Magdalene's robes. This suggests that the Magdalene panel was the first to be cut from the larger work.\nAt an unknown point before 1811, the original altarpiece was broken into at least three pieces, possibly due to damage, although The Magdalen fragment is in good condition. The black overpaint was likely added after the early 17th century when Netherlandish painting had fallen from favour and was unfashionable. Campbell believes that after the removal of the background detail \"it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch seventeenth-century paintings\". From the size of three surviving panels in relation to the drawing, it is estimated that the original was at least 1 m high by 1.5 m wide; the bishop and the Magdalene seem to clearly mark the horizontal extremities, but the extent of the picture above and below the surviving elements and the drawing cannot be judged. Such a size is comparable with smaller altarpieces of the period. The background was overpainted with a thick layer of black/brown pigment until it was cleaned in 1955; it was only after the layer's removal that it was linked to the upper body and head of Joseph from the Lisbon piece. These two works were not recorded in inventory until 1907, when they appear in the collection of L\u00e9o Lardus in Suresnes, France.The London panel shows much of the clothing of two other figures from the original altarpiece. To the left of the Magdalene is the red robe of what appears to be a kneeling figure. The figure and robe, and less precisely the background, match a kneeling Saint John the Evangelist. Behind the Magdalen is a standing figure in blue and red robes, with linear rosary beads in one hand and a walking stick in the other. A panel at the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian in Lisbon shows the head of a figure believed to be the Saint Joseph; the background and clothes match with those of the figure behind the Magdalen on the London panel.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magdalen_Reading", "title": "The Magdalen Reading", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the original that was estimated to be at least 1 m high by 1.5 m wide?", "query_id": "d63842336cda1c88170a3c2c12bdf29937281804", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Virgin and Child with Saints"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Virgin and Child with Saints", "answer_start": 0}]}]}, "ba77b93d26933122dcbd99e0663714a5af314c28": {"passage": "Notable sportsmen from Karnataka include B.S.

During late nights, Croft and Sim either shared lyrics with each other through instant messaging or rehearsed quietly with Smith and Qureshi in their bedrooms so they would not disturb the rest of the household. The xx were greatly influenced by American R&B producers such as The Neptunes and Timbaland, whose minimalist productions incorporated vocal harmonies, clapping percussion, unconventional samples, and pronounced beats. The band covered Aaliyah's \"Hot Like Fire\" (1997), Womack & Womack's \"Teardrops\" (1988), and other past R&B hits when they performed live and recorded their demos.After posting the demos on their Myspace page, the xx drew the interest of Young Turks, an imprint label of XL Recordings. They submitted the demos to XL's head office at Ladbroke Grove and were subsequently signed to a recording contract.

Anne Scott-James sets out the principles of the design: \"a garden of formal structure, of a private and secret nature, truly English in character, and plant[ed] with romantic profusion\". As gardeners and landscapers, both Sackville-West and Nicolson were amateurs. Nicolson largely undertook the design and Sackville-West the planting. The landscape is designed as a series of \"garden rooms\", each with a different character of colour or theme, the enclosures being high clipped hedges and pink brick walls. The rooms and \"doors\" are so arranged as to offer glimpses into other parts of the garden.\nSackville-West described the overall design: \"a combination of long axial walks, usually with terminal points, and the more intimate surprise of small geometrical gardens opening off them, rather as the rooms of an enormous house would open off the corridors\". Nicolson considered the garden's success was down to this \"succession of privacies: the forecourt, the first arch, the main court, the tower arch, the lawn, the orchard. All a series of escapes from the world, giving the impression of cumulative escape\". In the White Garden and along some paths in other gardens, the flower beds were set off from the paths by closely clipped low square hedges of box.\nSackville-West's planting philosophy is summed up in the advice from one of her gardening columns in the Observer: \"Cram, cram, cram, every chink and cranny\". Gardener Sarah Raven (Adam Nicolson's wife) notes the use of the vertical dimension, as well as horizontal paths, in her planting. Assisted by the number of walls still standing from the Tudor manor, and constructing more of her own, Sackville-West remarked \"I see we are going to have heaps of wall space for climbing things.\"Old roses formed the centrepiece of the planting, and their history appealed to her as much as their appearance did: \"there is nothing scrimpy or stingy about them. They have a generosity which is as desirable in plants as in people\", and ultimately around 200 varieties were grown at Sissinghurst.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sissinghurst_Castle_Garden", "title": "Sissinghurst Castle Garden", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the full name of the gardener that was married to the man who was behind the design of the gardens?", "query_id": "df9c33b7e1a98f6a5873a1450dbac2a16fba2231", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Sarah Raven"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Sarah Raven", "answer_start": 1542}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person that is married to the woman noted vertical dimensions in her planting?", "query_id": "f6c785260c1d2e849a1c9c549eddf7c1c63e54fe", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Adam Nicolson"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Adam Nicolson", "answer_start": 1555}]}]}, "3dd5b7569216dec985c55697b1e5a60f4ba3c07e": {"passage": "Georgi, an illiterate member of a wandering band of Gypsies led by Yakov escapes from a travelling medicine show after he innocently lets slip that the elixir they're selling is a fraud.

After a Mexican soldier bludgeoned a Gonzales resident on September 10, 1835, tensions rose even further, and Mexican authorities felt it unwise to leave the settlers with a weapon. Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea, commander of all Mexican military forces in Texas, sent a small detachment of troops to retrieve the cannon. After settlers escorted the group from town without the cannon, Ugartechea sent 100 dragoons with Lieutenant Francisco de Casta\u00f1eda to demand compliance, with orders to avoid force if possible.Many of the settlers believed Mexican authorities were manufacturing an excuse to attack the town and eliminate the militia. Texians stalled Casta\u00f1eda's attempts to negotiate the cannon's return for several days as they waited for reinforcements from other colonies.  In the early hours of October 2, approximately 140 Texian volunteers attacked Casta\u00f1eda's force. After a brief skirmish, Casta\u00f1eda requested a meeting with Texian leader John Henry Moore.  Casta\u00f1eda revealed that he shared their federalist leanings, but that he was honor-bound to follow orders.  As Moore returned to camp, the Texians raised a homemade white banner with an image of the cannon painted in black in the center, over the words \"Come and Take It\".  Realizing that he was outnumbered and outgunned, Casta\u00f1eda led his troops back to B\u00e9xar.  In this first battle of the revolution, two Mexican soldiers were killed, and one Texian was injured when he fell off his horse. Although the event was, as characterized by historian William C. Davis, \"an inconsequential skirmish in which one side did not try to fight\", Texians soon declared it a victory over Mexican troops.  News of the skirmish spread throughout the United States, encouraging many adventurers to come to Texas to join the fight.Volunteers continued to arrive in Gonzales. On October 11, the troops unanimously elected Austin, who had no official military experience, the leader of the group he had dubbed the Army of the People.  From the beginning, the volunteer army proved to have little discipline.  Austin's first official order was to remind his men that they were expected to obey their commanding officers.  Buoyed by their victory, the Texians were determined to drive the Mexican army out of Texas, and they began preparing to march to B\u00e9xar.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Revolution", "title": "Texas Revolution", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the first name of the person whose attempts to negotiate the cannon's return were stalled for several days?", "query_id": "7da5023482693524a3f3d39771b118dcd314c646", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Francisco"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Francisco", "answer_start": 545}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person for whom Texians raised a homemade white banner with an image of the cannon painted in black in the center on his return?

Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years.\nIn 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar.

Originally described by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, it is closely related to Sanford's sea eagle of the Solomon Islands, and the two are considered a superspecies. A distinctive bird, the adult white-bellied sea eagle has a white head, breast, under-wing coverts and tail. The upper parts are grey and the black under-wing flight feathers contrast with the white coverts. The tail is short and wedge-shaped as in all Haliaeetus species. Like many raptors, the female is slightly larger than the male, and can measure up to 90 cm (35 in) long with a wingspan of up to 2.2 m (7.2 ft), and weigh 4.5 kg (9.9 lb). Immature birds have brown plumage, which is gradually replaced by white until the age of five or six years. The call is a loud goose-like honking.\nResident from India and Sri Lanka through Southeast Asia to Australia on coasts and major waterways, the white-bellied sea eagle breeds and hunts near water, and fish form around half of its diet. Opportunistic, it consumes carrion and a wide variety of animals. Although rated as Least Concern globally, it has declined in parts of southeast Asia such as Thailand, and southeastern Australia. It is ranked as Threatened in Victoria and Vulnerable in South Australia and Tasmania. Human disturbance to its habitat is the main threat, both from direct human activity near nests which impacts on breeding success, and from removal of suitable trees for nesting.

The heroic female warrior Britomart (representing both chastity and Elizabeth I) battles through obstacles to reach the chamber in which Amoret is being held, and slays Busirane moments before he is able to kill Amoret.Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was intended by Etty to illustrate the virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart as he prepares to kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she swings her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.In the original poem, Busirane had tortured and cut out the heart of the still-living Amoret by the time of her rescue. When he came to paint Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret Etty had created numerous scenes of combat and death, and would later achieve a degree of critical approbation when it became known that he visited mortuaries to sketch cadavers to ensure the accuracy of his depictions of bodies in varying stages of decomposition. However, he had an aversion to \"the offensive and revolting butchery, some have delighted and even revelled in\", and disliked the depiction of gratuitous violence. Consequently, in Etty's work Amoret is depicted as physically unharmed by her ordeal, although his composition implies \"sadistic torture and occult sexual sorcery\".\nAlthough there is a strong suggestion in his letters that in his early years he had a sexual encounter with one of his models and possibly also a sexual encounter of some kind while in Venice in 1823\u201324, Etty was devoutly Christian and famously abstemious. Alison Smith considers the composition of Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret a conscious effort on his part to praise the virtue of chastity by creating a \"challenge for the presumably male viewer ... to vanquish lust and cast a pure gaze on vulnerable womanhood\". Throughout his career Etty had championed the use of female models in life classes, creating some controversy, and this painting may have been intended to emphasise his belief that \"To the pure in heart all things are pure\".", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britomart_Redeems_Faire_Amoret", "title": "Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the

years, 1704\u201306, under the influence of Johann Mattheson. In 1706 he traveled to Italy where he remained for three years, developing his compositional skills. He first settled in Florence where he was introduced to Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti. His first opera composed in Italy, though still reflecting the influence of Hamburg and Mattheson, was Rodrigo (1707, original title Vincer se stesso \u00ea la maggior vittoria), was presented there. It was not particularly successful, but was part of Handel's process of learning to compose opera in the Italian style and to set Italian words to music.Handel then spent time in Rome, where the performance of opera was forbidden by Papal decree, and in Naples. He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and oratorios; at that time there was little difference (apart from increasing length) between cantata, oratorio and opera, all based on the alternation of secco recitative and aria da capo. Works from this period include Dixit Dominus and the dramatic cantata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, written in Naples. While in Rome, probably through Alessandro Scarlatti, Handel had become acquainted with Cardinal Grimani, a distinguished diplomat who wrote libretti in his spare time, and acted as an unofficial theatrical agent for the Italian royal courts. He was evidently impressed by Handel and asked him to set his new libretto, Agrippina. Grimani intended to present this opera at his family-owned theatre in Venice, the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo, as part of the 1709\u201310 Carnevale season.", "wiki_url":

From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.Although when he chose, Massenet could write noisy and dissonant scenes \u2013 in 1885 Bernard Shaw called him \"one of the loudest of modern composers\" \u2013 much of his music is soft and delicate. Hostile critics have seized on this characteristic, but the article on Massenet in the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians observes that in the best of his operas this sensual side \"is balanced by strong dramatic tension (as in Werther), theatrical action (as in Th\u00e9r\u00e8se), scenic diversion (as in Esclarmonde), or humour (as in Le portrait de Manon).\"Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly attracted by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists a great number of locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India and Revolutionary Paris. Massenet's practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments.

The British Concorde prototype made its maiden flight from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, five weeks after the French test flight. In 2003 British Airways and Air France decided to discontinue Concorde flights, retiring the aircraft to locations (primarily museums) worldwide. On 26 November 2003 Concorde 216 made the final Concorde flight, returning to Bristol Filton Airport as the centrepiece of a proposed air museum which is planned to include the existing Bristol Aero collection (including a Bristol Britannia).The aerospace industry remains a major sector of the local economy. Major aerospace companies in Bristol include BAE Systems, a merger of Marconi Electronic Systems and BAe (the latter a merger of BAC, Hawker Siddeley and Scottish Aviation). Airbus and Rolls-Royce are also based at Filton, and aerospace engineering is an area of research at the University of the West of England. Another aviation company in the city is Cameron Balloons, who manufacture hot air balloons; each August the city hosts the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, one of Europe's largest hot-air balloon festivals.In 2005 Bristol was named by the UK government one of England's six science cities. A \u00a3500 million shopping centre, Cabot Circus, opened in 2008 amidst predictions by developers and politicians that the city would become one of England's top ten retail destinations. The Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone, focused on creative, high-tech and low-carbon industries around Bristol Temple Meads railway station, was announced in 2011 and launched the following year. The 70-hectare (170-acre) Urban Enterprise Zone has streamlined planning procedures and reduced business rates. Rates generated by the zone are channelled to five other designated enterprise areas in the region: Avonmouth, Bath, Bristol and Bath Science Park in Emersons Green, Filton, and Weston-super-Mare. Bristol is the only big city whose wealth per capita is higher than that of Britain as a whole.

The floor of the Everglades formed between 25 million and 2 million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present.\nShorter hydroperiods of three or four months promote the growth of periphyton: algae and other microscopic organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod.\nFive types of peat appear in the Everglades system; each type supports a specific type of vegetation, such as sawgrass, tree islands, or custard apple trees. Peat buildup is possible because water prevents oxygen from quickly decomposing plant matter. Once peat buildup reaches the surface, oxygen reacts with the microorganisms to decay the peat rapidly in a process called subsidence. Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful, but the nutrients in the peat quickly deteriorated by drying, and were broken down by bacteria in the soil. The dried peat burned or was degraded into carbon dioxide and water by microorganisms. Some homes built near early farms had to restructure their foundations on stilts as the peat deteriorated; other areas lost approximately 8 feet (2.4 m) of soil depth.

A number of writers mentioned Bertin's eventful career, in tones that were, according to art historian Andrew Carrington Shelton, either \"bitingly sarcastic [or] fawningly reverential\". There were many satirical reproductions and pointed editorials in the following years. Aware of Bertin's support of the July Monarchy, writers at the La Gazette de France viewed the portrait as the epitome of the \"opportunism and cynicism\" of the new regime. Their anonymous critic excitedly wondered \"what bitter irony it expresses, what hardened skepticism, sarcasm and ... pronounced cynicism\".Several critics mentioned Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century art historian Albert Boime described them as \"powerful, vulturine ... grasping his thighs in a gesture ... projecting ... enormous strength controlled\". Some contemporary critics were not so kind. The photographer and critic F\u00e9lix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged what he saw as a \"fantastical bundle of flesh ... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines \u2013 this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!\" Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: \"A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality ... the energetic and mighty nature\".The work's realism attracted a large amount of commentary when it was first exhibited. Some saw it as an affront to Romanticism, others said that its small details not only showed an acute likeness, but built a psychological profile of the sitter. Art historian Geraldine Pelles sees Bertin as \"at once intense, suspicious, and aggressive\". She notes that there is a certain amount of projection of the artist's personality and recalls Th\u00e9ophile Silvestre's description of Ingres; \"There he was squarely seated in an armchair, motionless as an Egyptian god carved of granite, his hands stretched wide over parallel knees, his torso stiff, his head haughty\". Some compared it to Balthasar Denner, a German realist painter influenced by Jan van Eyck. Denner, in the words of Ingres scholar Robert Rosenblum, \"specialised in recording every last line on the faces of aged men and women, and even reflections of windows in their eyes.\" The comparison was made by Ingres' admirers and detractors alike. In 1833, Louis de Maynard of the Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Amp\u00e8re, writing in the influential L'Europe litt\u00e9raire, dismissed Denner as a weak painter concerned with hyperrealistic \"curiosities\", and said that both he and Ingres fell short of the \"sublime productions of Ingres' self-proclaimed hero, Raphael.\"The following year Ingres sought to capitalise on the success of his Bertin portrait. He showed his ambitious history painting The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian at the 1834 Salon, but it was harshly criticised; even Ingres' admirers offered only faint praise. Offended and frustrated, Ingres declared he would disown the Salon, abandon his residence in Paris for Rome, and relinquish all current positions, ending his role in public life. This petulance was not to last.Bertin bequeathed the portrait to his daughter Louise (1805\u20131877) on his death. She passed it to her niece Marie-Louise-Sophie Bertin (1836\u20131893) wife of Jules Bapst, a later director of the Journal des d\u00e9bats. They bequeathed it to their niece C\u00e9cile Bapst, its last private owner.

These Soay sheep are believed to be remnants of the earliest sheep kept in Europe in the Neolithic Era, and are small, short-tailed, usually brown with white bellies, and have naturally moulting fleeces.  About 200 Soay sheep remain on Soay itself, and soon after the evacuation a second feral population of them was established on Hirta, which at that time had no sheep; these now number between 600 and 1,700.

The record opened at number one on the Billboard 200, making Jackson the first female artist in the Nielsen SoundScan era to do so. Certified sixfold platinum by the RIAA, it sold over 14 million copies worldwide.Janet spawned five singles and four promotional singles, receiving various certifications worldwide. The lead single \"That's the Way Love Goes\" won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Song and topped the Billboard Hot 100 for eight consecutive weeks. \"Again\" reached number one for two weeks, while \"If\" and \"Any Time, Any Place\" peaked in the top four. \"Because of Love\" and \"You Want This\" charted within the top ten.The album experimented with a diverse number of genres, including contemporary R&B, deep house, swing jazz, hip hop, rock, and pop, with Billboard describing each as being \"delivered with consummate skill and passion.\" Jackson took a larger role in songwriting and production than she did on her previous albums, explaining she found it necessary \"to write all the lyrics and half of the melodies\" while also speaking candidly about incorporating her sexuality into the album's content. Rolling Stone wrote \"[a]s princess of America's black royal family, everything Janet Jackson does is important. Whether proclaiming herself in charge of her life, as she did on Control (1986), or commander in chief of a rhythm army dancing to fight society's problems (Rhythm Nation 1814, from 1989), she's influential. And when she announces her sexual maturity, as she does on her new album, Janet., it's a cultural moment.\"In July 1993, Jackson made her film debut in Poetic Justice. While the film received mixed reviews, her performance was described as \"beguiling\" and \"believably eccentric.\" Jackson's ballad \"Again\", which was written for the film, received Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for \"Best Original Song.\"In September 1993, Jackson appeared topless on the cover of Rolling Stone, with her breasts covered by her then-husband, Ren\u00e9 Elizondo, Jr. The photograph is the original version of the cropped image used on the Janet album cover, shot by Patrick Demarchelier. The Vancouver Sun reported, \"Jackson, 27, remains clearly established as both role model and sex symbol; the Rolling Stone photo of Jackson ... became one of the most recognizable, and most lampooned, magazine covers.\"The Janet World Tour launched in support of the studio album garnered criticism for Jackson's lack of vocal proficiency and spontaneity, but earned critical acclaim for her showmanship.

Kill 'Em All is regarded as a groundbreaking album for thrash metal because of its precise musicianship, which fuses new wave of British heavy metal riffs with hardcore punk tempos. The album's musical approach and lyrics were markedly different from rock's mainstream of the early 1980s and inspired a number of bands who followed in similar manner. The album did not enter the Billboard 200 until 1986, when it peaked at number 155, following Metallica's commercial success with its third studio album Master of Puppets; the 1988 Elektra reissue peaked at number 120. Kill 'Em All was critically praised at the time of its release and in retrospect, and was placed on a few publications' best album lists. It was certified 3\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1999 for shipping three million copies in the United States. The album generated two singles, \"Whiplash\" and \"Jump in the Fire\".\nMetallica began by playing shows in local clubs in Los Angeles. They recorded several demos to gain attention from club owners, and eventually relocated to San Francisco to secure the services of bassist Cliff Burton. The group's No Life 'til Leather demo tape (1982) was noticed by Megaforce label head Jon Zazula, who signed them and provided a budget of $15,000 for recording. The album was recorded in May with producer Paul Curcio at the Music America Studios in Rochester, New York. It was originally intended to be titled Metal Up Your Ass, with cover art featuring a hand clutching a dagger emerging from a toilet bowl. The band was asked to change the name because distributors feared that releasing an album with such an offensive title and artwork would diminish its chances of commercial success. Metallica promoted the album on the two-month co-headlining Kill 'Em All for One tour with English heavy metal band Raven in the U.S. Although the initial shipment was 15,000 copies in the U.S., the album sold 60,000 copies worldwide by the end of Metallica's Seven Dates of Hell European tour in 1984.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_%27Em_All", "title": "Kill 'Em All", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What Metallica album did Elektra reissue in 1988?", "query_id": "60cb18b415a746e19ca96a4366ab182a3060d8ae", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Kill 'Em All"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Kill 'Em All", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "What was the original title for Kill 'Em All?", "query_id": "6f6a89eb964536f5fe996740bb958f9ac0c538eb", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Metal Up Your Ass"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Metal Up Your Ass", "answer_start": 1615}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the leader of the independent label that released Kill 'Em All?", "query_id": "801c3e32333dc1fd9dbfcc02002b82e912d79d5e", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Zazula"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Zazula", "answer_start": 1394}]}, {"question": "Who was the newest member of the band when Kill Em All was recorded?", "query_id": "47e834c5f1e0e7bf9113d58fc67077237f3ff957", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Cliff Burton"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Cliff Burton", "answer_start": 1290}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who provided Metallica with a budget of $15,000 for recording?", "query_id": "8d548ee9bd27819afd7bd57afbc8e3fa4a7d885b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Jon"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Jon", "answer_start": 1390}]}, {"question": "What album was reissued?", "query_id": "e9b4de73d65d39cd18a4f9ef771db7a9907834e6", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Kill 'Em All"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Kill 'Em All", "answer_start": 0}]}]}, "5e0139e572cdde15c6a8d4ac2c941f7833f72e17": {"passage": "Employee John David Welles attempts to steal rocket booster plans from the Groundstar facility.

Nick calls the source of his visions VALIS.\nOne recurring symbol that he has been seeing is an ichthys. While he and Phil sit at a table, an orbiting satellite shoots a pink laser directly into Nick's head. He rushes his son to the ER, convinced that he has an inguinal hernia.

Philip refuses to divulge anything about Nick.\nMeanwhile, Nick has a dream where a woman is singing. During the dream, someone comments that there is something about her singing that seems subversive. Eventually, the woman turns up at Nick's record label, looking for a clerical job.

They had intended the album, recorded between August and October 1964, to continue the format established by A Hard Day's Night which, unlike their first two LPs, contained only original songs. They had nearly exhausted their backlog of songs on the previous album, however, and given the challenges constant international touring posed to their songwriting efforts, Lennon admitted, \"Material's becoming a hell of a problem\". As a result, six covers from their extensive repertoire were chosen to complete the album. Released in early December, its eight original compositions stood out, demonstrating the growing maturity of the Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting partnership.In early 1965, following a dinner with Lennon, Harrison and their wives, Harrison's dentist John Riley secretly added LSD to their coffee. Lennon described the experience: \"It was just terrifying, but it was fantastic. I was pretty stunned for a month or two.\" He and Harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug, joined by Starr on at least one occasion. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: \"For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them.

In 1901, the Blakeney and Cley Wild Bird Protection Society created a bird sanctuary and appointed as its \"watcher\", Bob Pinchen, the first of only six men, up to 2012, to hold that post.In 1910, the owner of the Point, Augustus Cholmondeley Gough-Calthorpe, 6th Baron Calthorpe, leased the land to University College London (UCL), who also purchased the Old Lifeboat House at the end of the spit. When the baron died later that year, his heirs put Blakeney Point up for sale, raising the possibility of development. In 1912, a public appeal initiated by Charles Rothschild and organised by UCL Professor Francis Wall Oliver and Dr Sidney Long enabled the purchase of Blakeney Point from the Calthorpe estate, and the land was then donated to the National Trust. UCL established a research centre at the Old Lifeboat House in 1913, where Oliver and his college pioneered the scientific study of Blakeney Point. The building is still used by students, and also acts as an information centre.

Instruments can be placed in the drilled holes to record temperature, pressure, speed, direction of movement, and for other scientific research, such as neutrino detection.\nMany different methods have been used since 1840, when the first scientific ice drilling expedition attempted to drill through the Unteraargletscher in the Alps.  Two early methods were percussion, in which the ice is fractured and pulverized, and rotary drilling, a method often used in mineral exploration for rock drilling.  In the 1940s, thermal drills began to be used; these drills melt the ice by heating the drill.  Drills that use jets of hot water or steam to bore through ice soon followed.  A growing interest in ice cores, used for palaeoclimatological research, led to ice coring drills being developed in the 1950s and 1960s, and there are now many different coring drills in use.  For obtaining ice cores from deep holes, most investigators use cable-suspended electromechanical drills, which use an armoured cable to carry electrical power to a mechanical drill at the bottom of the borehole.\nIn 1966, a US team successfully drilled through the Greenland ice sheet at Camp Century, at a depth of 1,387 metres (4,551 ft).  Since then many other groups have succeeded in reaching bedrock through the two largest ice sheets, in Greenland and Antarctica.  Recent projects have focused on finding drilling locations that will give scientists access to very old undisturbed ice at the bottom of the borehole, since an undisturbed stratigraphic sequence is required to accurately date the information obtained from the ice.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_drilling", "title": "Ice drilling", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Percussion and rotary drilling are two early methods of what?", "query_id": "8c94fe11f19bd994b16eb731fcedf43a7f366ea0", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Ice drilling"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Ice drilling", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "Percussion and rotary drilling were two early methods of what?", "query_id": "ed0ef39241d9cc9ae1d5d2c50d5bac13c84bb8ac", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Ice drilling"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Ice drilling", "answer_start": 0}]}]}, "37c4543d111fc69f63414c630165789cd56ba496": {"passage": "Following an establishing shot of the New York City skyline, an elevator in a busy office building opens and happy-go-lucky Sky Ames steps out.

This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413\u20131422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton. With the help of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (nicknamed \"the Kingmaker\") Henry recaptured the throne for a short time in 1470. However, Edward IV soon regained control and Henry VI was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he was probably murdered. During the wars, the Tower was fortified to withstand gunfire, and provided with loopholes for cannons and handguns: an enclosure was created for this purpose to the south of Tower Hill, although it no longer survives.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London", "title": "Tower of London", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the last name of the person who was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill?", "query_id": "e7faa0be962b81ced56ed85797c8044bf600b8e0", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Sudbury"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Sudbury", "answer_start": 449}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the castle the crowd broke into without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House?", "query_id": "680b379dd4c9e2361a55b427124dd4bda419a5d8", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Tower of London"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Tower of London", "answer_start": 213}]}, {"question": "What was the title of the person who was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill?", "query_id": "7f8602ad8b97a4e76ff936dab00f2ec71325a6d2", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The Archbishop of Canterbury"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The Archbishop of Canterbury", "answer_start": 413}]}, {"question": "Who abdicated?", "query_id": "5c3cfcef7c19c347722caa3797bba13dc6712c49", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Richard II"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Richard II", "answer_start": 5}]}, {"question": "What was the full name of the location where Richard II began his procession?", "query_id": "6a4f0d68c92d8e11a4e71ed1416c7cb12815ad48", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["the Tower of London"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "the Tower of London", "answer_start": 209}]}, {"question": "What was the last name of the person who hoped that the mob would respect the sanctuary?", "query_id": "6932a1523c02be25f8f1dc06191b386a73443324", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Sudbury"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Sudbury", "answer_start": 449}]}, {"question": "What was the more usual location where Richard would spend Christmas?", "query_id": "806a4a9f94e303b2440809e86a28f75f7d7892f6", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Windsor"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Windsor", "answer_start": 705}]}, {"question": "What was the full name of the person who replaced Richard on the throne?", "query_id": "becf6415304ccd9c24448de4308b260e900bbff1", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Henry Bolingbroke"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Henry Bolingbroke", "answer_start": 737}]}, {"question": "What was Bolingbroke's name when he replaced Richard II from the throne?", "query_id": "28e2ade2eaa31cd1119d74e48d07ae22ed899e5a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["King Henry IV"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "King Henry IV", "answer_start": 898}]}, {"question": "What was the position of the person who was beheaded on Tower Hill?", "query_id": "894f69e175dd7dd3cc3ff0deb426938c40eecad5", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The Archbishop of Canterbury"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The Archbishop of Canterbury", "answer_start": 413}]}, {"question": "What was one of Henry V's victories?", "query_id": "cfc0bce0ddb60ee39068a25bf63f28e648b5ecfb", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["the Battle of Agincourt"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "the Battle of Agincourt", "answer_start": 1505}]}, {"question": "What was Neville's nickname?", "query_id": "e77595b55e6879d880e2493ae1c757ea94045005", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["the Kingmaker"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "the Kingmaker", "answer_start": 2027}]}, {"question": "What was the full name of \"the Kingmaker'?", "query_id": "e876ec7eeee6829343c192fa110138056c145221", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Richard Neville,"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Richard Neville,", "answer_start": 1977}]}, {"question": "What two countries were against each other in the Hundred Years' War?", "query_id": "b9ce6da5c909ffa599f52882dbe34ad0e12b6615", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["England", "France"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "England", "answer_start": 1403}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 1455}]}]}, "cb2e6c0b2ba6003dc4d81598ca7369bdd597f772": {"passage": "Amyntas III was forced to flee his kingdom in either 393 or 383 BC (based on conflicting accounts), owing to a massive invasion by the Illyrian Dardani led by Bardylis.

Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze\u2014a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.\nBy the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor.\nFuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea. When the painting was put up for sale in 2012, the auction house catalogue stated that it had been owned by William Ride, former director of the Western Australian Museum. It reported:The current owners assert that Professor Ride always understood the figures in the picture were Sir John Winthrop Hackett, (then owner of The West Australian newspaper, well known business man and philanthropist, whose gift allowed the construction of the impressive University of Western Australia buildings and St. George's Residential College) and his new wife, Deborah Vernon Hackett\".", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Fuller", "title": "Florence Fuller", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the painting that is 109 cm high and 135 cm wide?", "query_id": "56a7f237c0bf356f5983c6aaf941ed787119ae68", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["A Golden Hour"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "A Golden Hour", "answer_start": 1563}]}, {"question": "What is the title of the painting that portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon?", "query_id": "8075e91373ee286653a84c814db44be32fbdfdb5", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["A Golden Hour"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "A Golden Hour", "answer_start": 1563}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the previous owner of the painting that portrays Sir John Winthrop Hackett?", "query_id": "8ed6d0de358d9548e5882d361924028963d1f743", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["William Ride"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "William Ride", "answer_start": 2062}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the gallery chairman that had his portrait by the gallery he chaired?", "query_id": "3fe9fe54b408a93124a192706badf4a2af67b8ae", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["James George Lee Steere"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "James George Lee Steere", "answer_start": 1270}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the French-Australian student of the woman who lived with her singer sister in Western Australia?", "query_id": "8101ef3f7026922a6d2521aa646594bfc8b086db", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Kathleen O'Connor"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Kathleen O'Connor", "answer_start": 1499}]}, {"question": "What was described as being essentially Australian in almost every detail?", "query_id": "e78c8129ca99626cc68d9a27bdb24b48cb187c1e", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Summer Breezes"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Summer Breezes", "answer_start": 72}]}, {"question": "What was the last name of the person who painted a Western Australian politician?", "query_id": "d5dda8f14f79f1616458b2c31d26bd00ff2fca0b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Fuller"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Fuller", "answer_start": 52}]}, {"question": "What was the full name of the person that had a board that they chaired acquire a portrait of them?", "query_id": "7a67b222d144a79686afc0eec4236eaa92967c06", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["James George Lee"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "James George Lee", "answer_start": 1270}]}, {"question": "What was the last name of the person who took up a French-Australian student?", "query_id": "04926f8d056b46200de67f3fc4cb6176dc94a53e", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Fuller"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Fuller", "answer_start": 1012}]}, {"question": "What was the name of the painting that portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea?", "query_id": "1882a5708f86233c8797d0c6c53539b232b9efb8", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["A Golden Hour"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "A Golden Hour", "answer_start": 1563}]}, {"question": "What was the name of the painting that was put up for sale in 2012?", "query_id": "6921b348d638cc0ab34f072e2831d5ce7f75f55a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["A Golden Hour"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "A Golden Hour", "answer_start": 1563}]}, {"question": "What was the name of the painting that the auction house catalogue stated that it had been owned by William Ride, former director of the Western Australian Museum?", "query_id": "1c05b316bcccb170ffcc14b045b6d9df8456239f", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["A Golden Hour"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "A Golden Hour", "answer_start": 1563}]}]}, "2ca4086423b8aaff2d59000d30ccea56f5c027f9": {"passage": "In 1885\u201387 the partnership designed Abbeystead House for the 4th Earl of Sefton in North Lancashire. Hubbard describes this as \"the finest of Douglas's Elizabethan houses, and one of the largest which he ever designed\". During this time additions were made to Jodrell Hall in Cheshire and Halkyn Castle in Flintshire. In 1885 the Castle Hotel at Conwy, Caernarfonshire, was remodelled, and in 1887\u201388 a strongroom was added to Hawarden Castle, followed by a porch in 1890. During this period more buildings were added to the Eaton Hall estate, and these included houses and cottages, such as Eccleston Hill, and Eccleston Ferry House, and farms such as Saighton Lane Farm. In 1890\u201391 an obelisk was built in the Belgrave Avenue approach to Eaton Hall. The last house designed by Douglas on a large scale was Brocksford Hall (1893) in Derbyshire. This was a country house in Elizabethan style using diapered brick and stone dressings with a clock tower. In Chester city centre, 38 Bridge Street (1897) is a timber-framed shop that incorporates a section of Chester Rows and contains heavily decorated carving. From 1892 the partnership designed houses and cottages in Port Sunlight for Lever Brothers. Also in the village they designed the Dell Bridge (1894), and the school (1894\u201396), which is now called the Lyceum. In 1896 Douglas designed a house for himself, Walmoor Hill in Dee Banks, Chester, in Elizabethan style. Between 1895 and 1897 he designed a range of buildings on the east side of St Werburgh Street in the centre of Chester. At its south end, on the corner of Eastgate Street, is a bank whose ground storey is built in stone, and behind this leading up St Werburgh Street, the ground storey consists of shop fronts. Above this the range consists of two storeys plus an attic, which are covered in highly ornamented timber-framing. On the first floor is a series of oriel windows, the second floor is jettied, and at the top are eleven gables. Pevsner considers that this range of buildings is \"Douglas at his best (though also at his showiest)\".

On March 10, 1403, the Yongle Emperor invited Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama (1384\u20131415), to his court, even though the fourth Karmapa had rejected the invitation of the Hongwu Emperor. A Tibetan translation in the 16th century preserves the letter of the Yongle Emperor, which the Association for Asian Studies notes is polite and complimentary towards the Karmapa. The letter of invitation reads,My father and both parents of the queen are now dead. You are my only hope, essence of buddhahood. Please come quickly. I am sending as offering a large ingot of silver, one hundred fifty silver coins, twenty rolls of silk, a block of sandalwood, one hundred fifty bricks of tea and ten pounds of incense.\"\nIn order to seek out the Karmapa, the Yongle Emperor dispatched his eunuch Hou Xian and the Buddhist monk Zhi Guang (d. 1435) to Tibet.

Zhengtong had the following message delivered to the Great Treasure Prince of Dharma, the Karmapa:\nOut of compassion, Buddha taught people to be good and persuaded them to embrace his doctrines. You, who live in the remote Western Region, have inherited the true Buddhist doctrines. I am deeply impressed not only by the compassion with which you preach among the people in your region for their enlightenment, but also by your respect for the wishes of Heaven and your devotion to the Court. I am very pleased that you have sent bSod-nams-nyi-ma and other Tibetan monks here bringing with them statues of Buddha, horses and other specialties as tributes to the court.\nDespite this glowing message by the Emperor, Chan writes that a year later in 1446, the Ming court cut off all relations with the Karmapa hierarchs.

In the late 1970s, UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones combined pop-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist Ben Myers, Bad Religion \"layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies\"; Descendents \"wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys-inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)\". Epitaph Records, founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as the Queers and Screeching Weasel, began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like Green Day and the Offspring, who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as the Vandals and Guttermouth developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large Midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like Dillinger Four who would take a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\"", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "title": "Punk rock", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What bands were inspired by the light-hearted pop punk fusion bands?", "query_id": "f1ee440b8b86d5dbbb9ba58d3c72f2b744dd36db", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Green Day", "the Offspring"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Green Day", "answer_start": 938}, {"text": "the Offspring", "answer_start": 952}]}, {"question": "What bands were inspirations to the pop punk bands that achieved wide popularity?", "query_id": "e3c83c59d950777e3ba586a86d662e994b4b7739", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["the Queers", "Screeching Weasel"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "the Queers", "answer_start": 837}, {"text": "Screeching Weasel", "answer_start": 852}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person that is very critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands?", "query_id": "06bfa55d7db6cea8e28cb1390ddcb02b0f6bca4b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Christine Di Bella"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Christine Di Bella", "answer_start": 1646}]}, {"question": "What band was cited as an inspiration for the band that paved the way for pop punk?", "query_id": "cfa6fdecea87ae2f968df5bf843723f20ec5b688", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Beach Boys"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Beach Boys", "answer_start": 23}]}, {"question": "What is the band that started a substrate that still maintains its identity?", "query_id": "f4c7baaeb19ff47c1aed9a8186b1d992a0c70e19", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Dillinger Four"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Dillinger Four", "answer_start": 1288}]}]}, "2bb6a5aaa989291e34dddba52b08d83140f72c07": {"passage": "Apart from pieces purely in metal, a number are centred on either hardstone carvings or organic objects such as horns, seashells, ostrich eggshells, and exotic plant seeds.

Fragments of willow basket were found near the Glastonbury Lake Village, and it was used in the construction of several Iron Age causeways. The willow was harvested using traditional methods of pollarding, where a tree would be cut back to the main stem. New shoots of willow, called \"withies\", would grow out of the trunk and these would be cut periodically for use.During the 1930s, over 9,000 acres (36 km2) of willow were being grown commercially on the Levels. Largely because of the replacement of baskets by plastic bags and cardboard boxes, the industry has severely declined since the 1950s. By the end of the 20th century only about 350 acres (1.4 km2) were grown commercially, near the villages of Burrowbridge, Westonzoyland, and North Curry. The Somerset Levels is now the only area in the UK where basket willow is grown commercially. For weaving, the species Salix triandra (almond willow, black maul) is grown, while Salix viminalis (common osier) is ideal for handles, bases, and the structural members in furniture and hurdles. Historically willow was used to make salmon traps or \"putchers\". Products including baskets, eel traps (kypes), lobster pots, and furniture were widely made from willow throughout the area in the recent past. Among the more unusual products still made are passenger baskets for hot air balloons, the frames inside the Bearskins worn by the regiments of the Grenadier Guards, and an increasing number of willow coffins.Another use of willow has been found by the Coate family, who make artists' charcoals in Stoke St Gregory. It has become in 30 years the leading artists' charcoal manufacturer in Europe, producing most of the natural charcoals sold under different art-material brands.The industry is celebrated in the form of the Willow Man (sometimes known as the Angel of the South), a willow sculpture, 40 feet (12.2 m) tall, produced by artist Serena de la Hey in September 2000 that can be seen from the railway and the M5 motorway to the north of Bridgwater.

The period begins approximately with Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck in the 1420s and lasts at least until the death of Gerard David in 1523, although many scholars extend it to the start of the Dutch Revolt in 1566 or 1568 (Max J. Friedl\u00e4nder's acclaimed surveys run through Pieter Bruegel the Elder). Early Netherlandish painting coincides with the Early and High Italian Renaissance but the early period (until about 1500) is seen as an independent artistic evolution, separate from the Renaissance humanism that characterised developments in Italy, although beginning in the 1490s as increasing numbers of Netherlandish and other Northern painters traveled to Italy, Renaissance ideals and painting styles were incorporated into Netherlandish and other Northern painting. As a result, Early Netherlandish painters are often categorised as belonging to both the Northern Renaissance and the Late or International Gothic.\nThe major Netherlandish painters include Campin, van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Dieric Bouts, Petrus Christus, Hans Memling, Hugo van der Goes and Hieronymus Bosch. These artists made significant advances in natural representation and illusionism, and their work typically features complex iconography.  Their subjects are usually religious scenes or small portraits, with narrative painting or mythological subjects being relatively rare. Landscape is often richly described but relegated as a background detail before the early 16th century. The painted works are generally oil on panel, either as single works or more complex portable or fixed altarpieces in the form of diptychs, triptychs or polyptychs. The period is also noted for its sculpture, tapestries, illuminated manuscripts, stained glass and carved retables.\nThe first generations of artists were active during the height of Burgundian influence in Europe, when the Low Countries became the political and economic centre of Northern Europe, noted for its crafts and luxury goods. Assisted by the workshop system, panels and a variety of crafts were sold to foreign princes or merchants through private engagement or market stalls. A majority of the works were destroyed during waves of iconoclasm in the 16th and 17th centuries; today only a few thousand examples survive. Early northern art in general was not well regarded from the early 17th to the mid-19th century, and the painters and their works were not well documented until the mid-19th century. Art historians spent almost another century determining attributions, studying iconography, and establishing bare outlines of even the major artists' lives. Attribution of some of the most significant works is still debated.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Netherlandish_painting", "title": "Early Netherlandish painting", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What are the full names of the people who made significant advances in natural representation and illusionism?", "query_id": "4ad5454536ecc2d832e13c7dadb00a912a7d6a65", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Campin", "van Eyck", "Rogier van der Weyden", "Dieric Bouts", "Petrus Christus", "Hans Memling", "Hugo van der Goes", "Hieronymus Bosch"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Campin", "answer_start": 1290}, {"text": "van Eyck", "answer_start": 1298}, {"text": "Rogier van der Weyden", "answer_start": 1308}, {"text": "Dieric Bouts", "answer_start": 1331}, {"text": "Petrus Christus", "answer_start": 1345}, {"text": "Hans Memling", "answer_start": 1362}, {"text": "Hugo van der Goes", "answer_start": 1376}, {"text": "Hieronymus Bosch", "answer_start": 1398}]}]}, "517b2120a33076f1c28e6d032f02ce42e0d640b4": {"passage": "In 1948, Frank Wheeler meets April at a party.

Heavy metal subgenres experimental metal or avant-garde metal are umbrella terms that enable description of the career of the band in general. Extreme metal crosses both thrash metal and death metal (or technical death metal), which are at root of the sound of Meshuggah's music, which has also been described as groove metal. The band has also been labelled as math metal and progressive metal. Meshuggah also incorporates elements of experimental jazz. In its review of Nothing, Allmusic describes Meshuggah as \"masterminds of cosmic calculus metal\u2014call it Einstein metal if you want\". Meshuggah's early output was also considered alternative metal. Meshuggah creates a recognizable sonic imprint and distinct style.Trademarks and characteristics that define Meshuggah's sound and songwriting include polyrhythms, polymetered riff cycles, rhythmic syncopation, rapid key and tempo changes and neo-jazz chromatics. Hagstr\u00f6m notes that \"it doesn't really matter if something is hard to play or not. The thing is, what does it do to your mind when you listen to it? Where does it take you?\" A trademark of Thordendal is jazz fusion-like soloing and improvisation. He is also known for the usage of a \"breath controller\" device. Haake is known for his cross-rhythm drumming with \"jazzlike cadence\". The vocal style of Jens Kidman varies between hardcore-style shouts and \"robotic\" death metal vocals.In polymeters typically used by Meshuggah, the guitars might play in odd meters such as 5/16 or 17/16, while drums play in 4/4. One particular example of Haake's use of polymeter is 4/4 against 23/16 bimeter, in which he keeps the hi-hat and ride cymbal in 4/4 time but uses the snare and double bass drums in 23/16 time. On \"Rational Gaze\" (from Nothing), Haake plays simple 4/4 time, hitting the snare on each third beat, for 16 bars. At the same time, the guitars and bass are playing same quarter notes, albeit in a different time signature; eventually both sides meet up again at the 64th beat. Hagstr\u00f6m notes about the polymeters, \"We've never really been into the odd time signatures we get accused of using. Everything we do is based around a 4/4 core.

The work was produced in February 1959 at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, under Cocteau's direction, with Duval as the tragic deserted woman speaking to her former lover by telephone. In May Poulenc's 60th birthday was marked, a few months late, by his last concert with Bernac before the latter's retirement from public performance.Poulenc visited the US in 1960 and 1961. Among his works given during these trips were the American premiere of La Voix humaine at Carnegie Hall in New York, with Duval, and the world premiere of his Gloria, a large-scale work for soprano, four-part mixed chorus and orchestra, conducted in Boston by Charles Munch. In 1961 Poulenc published a book about Chabrier, a 187-page study of which a reviewer wrote in the 1980s, \"he writes with love and insight of a composer whose views he shared on matters like the primacy of melody and the essential seriousness of humour.\" The works of Poulenc's last twelve months included Sept r\u00e9pons des t\u00e9n\u00e8bres for voices and orchestra, the Clarinet Sonata and the Oboe Sonata.On 30 January 1963, at his flat opposite the Jardin du Luxembourg, Poulenc suffered a fatal heart attack.

Goya was seen as a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818\u201319). Luis Bu\u00f1uel identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'\u00c2ge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dal\u00ed, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.The series' impact on Dal\u00ed is evident in Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War), painted in 1936 in response to events leading to the Spanish Civil War. Here, the distorted limbs, brutal suppression, agonised expressions and ominous clouds are reminiscent of plate 39, Grande haza\u00f1a! Con muertos! (A heroic feat! With dead men!), in which mutilated bodies are shown against a backdrop barren landscape.In 1993, Jake and Dinos Chapman of the Young British Artists movement created 82 miniature, toy-like sculptures modelled on The Disasters of War. The works were widely acclaimed and purchased that year by the Tate gallery. For decades, Goya's series of etching served as a constant point of reference for the Chapman brothers; in particular, they created a number of variations based on the plate Grande haza\u00f1a! Con muertos!.\nIn 2003, the Chapman brothers exhibited an altered version of The Disasters of War. They purchased a complete set of prints, over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads. The Chapmans described their \"rectified\" images as making a connection between Napoleon's supposed introduction of Enlightenment ideals to early-19th-century Spain and Tony Blair and George W. Bush purporting to bring democracy to Iraq.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Disasters_of_War", "title": "The Disasters of War", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What are the first names of the people who purchased a complete set of prints, over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads?", "query_id": "cf74713f327a761ccf576783eec04dfc385879c6", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Jake", "Dinos"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Jake", "answer_start": 1241}, {"text": "Dinos", "answer_start": 1250}]}, {"question": "What are the first names of the two Chapman brothers who created a number of etching variations based on the plate Grande haza\u00f1a!

Sweden's first contest was the third, in 1958. Without broadcasting a public selection, Sveriges Radio (SR) chose to send Alice Babs to the contest in Hilversum, Netherlands. The song selected was \"Samma stj\u00e4rna lyser f\u00f6r oss tv\u00e5\" (The same stars shine for the two of us), later renamed \"Lilla stj\u00e4rna\" (Little star). It finished fourth at Eurovision on 12 March 1958.\nThe first Melodifestival, incorporated into the S\u00e4g det med musik radio series, took place on 29 January 1959 at Cirkus in Stockholm; eight songs participated. Four \"expert\" juries in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malm\u00f6, and Lule\u00e5 decided the winner. The competition was won by Siw Malmkvist performing \"Augustin\", but SR decided that the winning song\u2014regardless of its original performer\u2014would be performed by Brita Borg at Eurovision. This policy, of selecting the artist for Eurovision internally and having other artists perform potential Swedish entries at Melodifestivalen, was stopped in 1961. The competition became a stand-alone television programme in 1960, known as the Eurovisionschlagern, svensk final. In the event's early years, it was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network. The competition adopted its current name, Melodifestivalen, in 1967.\nThe Melodifestival has failed to be staged on three occasions. In 1964, the competition was cancelled due to an artist's strike; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year. Sweden was absent at Eurovision for a second time in 1970 because of a Nordic boycott of the voting system, which had led to a four-way tie for first place at the 1969 contest. After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm, left-wing groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again. This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti-commercial Alternativfestivalen. Therefore, Sweden decided not to send a song to Eurovision 1976, but returned in 1977.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodifestivalen", "title": "Melodifestivalen", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What competition became a stand-alone television programme in 1960?", "query_id": "ec0b3c4554fd69c7dbc03a92561c8e3fd37d5a2b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Eurovision Song Contest"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Eurovision Song Contest", "answer_start": 40}]}, {"question": "What event was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network in the early years?", "query_id": "b0b3abbd1023a99c26c98b59a8655e5f54c7e6ed", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Eurovision Song Contest"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Eurovision Song Contest", "answer_start": 40}]}]}, "0e495f9ccf7b1166b17fab9615735b181f49af16": {"passage": "The concert took place on Saturday, September 19, 1981, on the Great Lawn, the central open space of Central Park.

Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until the start of the concert, an estimated 500,000 audience members made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.The stage backdrop depicted an urban rooftop with water tank and air outlet, symbolic of New York's skyline.  At twilight, the backing band went onstage, followed by New York's mayor, Ed Koch, who announced, \"Ladies and gentlemen, Simon and Garfunkel!\" The duo entered through a side stage door, took center stage amid audience applause, looked at each other and shook hands, and began the concert with their 1968 hit \"Mrs. Robinson\".\nAfter the second song, \"Homeward Bound\", Simon delivered a short speech which began, \"Well, it's great to do a neighborhood concert.\" He then thanked the police, the fire department, the park administration and finally Ed Koch. The audience booed at the mention of Koch but applauded as Simon continued.\nSimon & Garfunkel played twenty-one songs in total: ten by the duo, eight by Simon, one by Garfunkel, a cover of  The Everly Brothers' \"Wake Up Little Susie\", and the medley version of \"Maybellene\". Each performer sang three songs alone, including one new song apiece. Garfunkel sang the Simon & Garfunkel classic \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" and \"April Come She Will\", and \"A Heart in New York\", a song written by Gallagher and Lyle that appeared on his album Scissors Cut, which had been released the previous month.

"Abaqa died in 1282 and was briefly replaced by his brother Tekuder, who had converted to Islam. Tekuder reversed Abaqa's policy of seeking an alliance with the Franks, offering instead an alliance to the Mamluk Sultan Qalawun, who continued his own advance, capturing the Hospitaller fortress of Margat in 1285, Lattakia in 1287, and the County of Tripoli in 1289. However, Tekuder's pro-Muslim stance was not popular, and in 1284, Abaqa's Buddhist son Arghun, with the support of the Great Khan Kublai, led a revolt and had Tekuder executed. Arghun then revived the idea of an alliance with the West, and sent multiple envoys to Europe.The first of Arghun's embassies was led by Isa Kelemechi, a Nestorian scientist who had been head of Kublai Khan's Office of Western Astronomy. Kelemechi met with Pope Honorius IV in 1285, offering to \"remove\" the Saracens (Muslims) and divide \"the land of Sham, namely Egypt\" with the Franks. The second embassy, and probably the most famous, was that of the elderly cleric Rabban Bar Sauma, who had been visiting the Ilkhanate during a remarkable pilgrimage from China to Jerusalem.Through Bar Sauma and other later envoys, such as Buscarello de Ghizolfi, Arghun promised the European leaders that if Jerusalem were conquered, he would have himself baptized and would return Jerusalem to the Christians. Bar Sauma was greeted warmly by the European monarchs, but Western Europe was no longer as interested in the Crusades, and the mission to form an alliance was ultimately fruitless.

As the days pass and he is unable to find employment, their household, which includes his sister, Lottie, and Bertha's brother, Dan Walsh, goes through what little savings they have.\nAs he gets more desperate, he agrees to do small jobs for \"Nifty\" Herman, a small-time gangster.  Nifty had loaned Johnny $15, as part of a plan to entice him to work for him.  After Johnny gets insulted by a common laborer job offer from a neighbor, Nifty lies to him and says that he has a friend who will get him a managerial position at a liquor store.  All Johnny has to do is hold onto a case of high-priced alcohol for a few days.  Dubious, Johnny reluctantly agrees and takes the suitcase back to his apartment.  However, when Bertha finds out who he got the suitcase from, she demands that he return it, threatening to leave him if he doesn't.\nTaking the case back to Nifty, he finds the office locked, and so returns home.  When he arrives, his sister's suitor, Charles Newton, is visiting.  Newton is a government agent.

Opening it, he discovers it contains a cache of drugs.  When he interrogates Johnny, he gets the whole story, and is about to arrest Johnny, when Nifty arrives to retrieve the suitcase.

It explores genres similar to Jackson's previous album, Off the Wall (1979), including pop, post-disco, rock and funk. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, with a production budget of $750,000.\nIn just over a year, Thriller became the world's best-selling album, having sold an estimated 66 million copies. It is the second-best-selling album in the United States, behind the Eagles' album Their Greatest Hits (1971\u20131975), and was the first to reach 30x platinum, with 33 million shipped album-equivalent units certified in the US. The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards in 1984, including Album of the Year. It produced seven singles\u2014\"The Girl Is Mine\", \"Billie Jean\", \"Beat It\", \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\u2009\", \"Human Nature\", \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\", and \"Thriller\"\u2014all of which reached the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Thriller broke racial barriers in pop music, enabling Jackson's appearances on MTV and meeting with President Ronald Reagan at the White House. The album was one of the first to use music videos as successful promotional tools, and the videos for the songs \"Thriller\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"Beat It\" all received regular rotation on MTV.\nIn 2001, a special edition reissue was released, which contains additional audio interviews, demo recordings and the song \"Someone in the Dark\", a Grammy-winning track from the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. In 2008, Thriller was reissued again as Thriller 25, containing remixes with contemporary artists, previously unreleased songs, and a DVD with three music videos and Jackson's performance of \"Billie Jean\" from the 1983 television special Motown 25.\nIn the same year, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame along with Off the Wall. In 2012, Slant Magazine named Thriller the best album of the 1980s\". In 2003, Rolling Stone placed the album at number 20 on their list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The album was listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers at number three on its \"Definitive 200\" album list.

Ramsey chose zero (a complete dud), Robert Oppenheimer chose 0.3 kilotons of TNT (1.3 TJ), Kistiakowsky 1.4 kilotons of TNT (5.9 TJ), and Bethe chose 8 kilotons of TNT (33 TJ). Rabi, the last to arrive, took 18 kilotons of TNT (75 TJ) by default, which would win him the pool. In a video interview, Bethe stated that his choice of 8 kt was exactly the value calculated by Segr\u00e8, and he was swayed by Segr\u00e8's authority over that of a more junior [but unnamed] member of Segr\u00e8's group who had calculated 20 kt. Enrico Fermi offered to take wagers among the top physicists and military present on whether the atmosphere would ignite, and if so whether it would destroy just the state, or incinerate the entire planet. This last result had been previously calculated by Bethe to be almost impossible, although for a while it had caused some of the scientists some anxiety. Bainbridge was furious with Fermi for scaring the guards who, unlike the physicists, did not have the advantage of their knowledge about the scientific possibilities. His own biggest fear was that nothing would happen, in which case he would have to head back to the tower to investigate.Julian Mack and Berlyn Brixner were responsible for photography. The photography group employed some fifty different cameras, taking motion and still photographs. Special Fastax cameras taking 10,000 frames per second would record the minute details of the explosion. Spectrograph cameras would record the wavelengths of light emitted by the explosion, and pinhole cameras would record gamma rays. A rotating drum spectrograph at the 10,000-yard (9,100 m) station would obtain the spectrum over the first hundredth of a second. Another, slow recording one would track the fireball. Cameras were placed in bunkers only 800 yards (730 m) from the tower, protected by steel and lead glass, and mounted on sleds so they could be towed out by the lead-lined tank. Some observers brought their own cameras despite the security. Segr\u00e9 brought in Jack Aeby's 35 mm Perfex 44.

Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.\nThe Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi Sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British Crown rule.

Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately $2 (US$4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold.\nAs a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of $12 (US$29 in 2018 dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, \"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item\u2014like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie\u2014and started selling like a household staple\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \"The whole industry has a stake in this success\". Time magazine speculated that \"the fallout from Thriller has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of $4.1 billion\". Time summed up Thriller's impact as a \"restoration of confidence\" for an industry bordering on \"the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop\".

Initially there was no direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of snow and ice were reported from aerial observations.\nAt 12:36 p.m. on March 27, phreatic eruptions (explosions of steam caused by magma suddenly heating groundwater) ejected and smashed rock from within the old summit crater, excavating a new crater 250 feet (75 m) wide, and sending an ash column about 7,000 feet (2.1 km) into the air. By this date a 16,000-foot-long (3.0 mi; 4.9 km) eastward-trending fracture system had also developed across the summit area.

Many of the women were dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654 recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later as a result of their wounds. It has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of the crowd was made up of women, suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that the women were especially targeted, a view apparently supported by the large number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons.Eleven of the fatalities listed occurred on St Peter's Field.

The following day Hook borrowed \u00a335 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \"Stiff Kittens\", but the band settled on \"Warsaw\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \"Warszawa\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions: driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off.In August 1977, Warsaw placed an advertisement in a music shop window seeking a replacement drummer. Stephen Morris, who had attended the same school as Curtis, was the sole respondent. Deborah Curtis, Ian's wife, stated that Morris \"fitted perfectly\" with the band, and that with his addition Warsaw became a \"complete 'family'\". To avoid confusion with the London punk band Warsaw Pakt, the band renamed themselves Joy Division in early 1978, borrowing the name from the sexual slavery wing of a Nazi concentration camp mentioned in the 1955 novel House of Dolls. In December, the group recorded their debut EP, An Ideal for Living, at Pennine Sound Studio and played their final gig as Warsaw on New Year's Eve at the Swinging Apple in Liverpool. Billed as Warsaw to ensure an audience, the band played their first gig as Joy Division on 25 January 1978 at Pip's Disco in Manchester.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Division", "title": "Joy Division", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What are the full names of the drummers of Warsaw?", "query_id": "1026ec365f042608da934ceaf3adf76254342707", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Tony Tabac", "Steve Brotherdale"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Tony Tabac", "answer_start": 1306}, {"text": "Steve Brotherdale", "answer_start": 1564}]}, {"question": "What two bands did Steve Brotherdale play drums for?", "query_id": "c4ade39d6ac9a11881c6d42002ac3ec0ccf06dd2", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Warsaw", "Panik"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Warsaw", "answer_start": 1104}, {"text": "Panik", "answer_start": 1616}]}, {"question": "What did Bernard's band rename itself in 1978?", "query_id": "dea0ef0f4a5d949bcedbfbb039aada8684746b74", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Joy Division"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Joy Division", "answer_start": 2448}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person that said Ian Curtis was the person the whole group was based on?", "query_id": "5bb71e659c85dd9dd4f726a2dc6c89e4a2f05c35", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Bernard Sumner"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Bernard Sumner", "answer_start": 35}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person that played drums for Warsaw on their first gig?", "query_id": "01b87b84520621bdfe8ca3330af7edcd2da82183", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Tony Tabac"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Tony Tabac", "answer_start": 1306}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person that was the manager for the band Warsaw?", "query_id": "9074f628d6f234dec5bfda84bf21a08e0dff3955", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Terry Mason"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Terry Mason", "answer_start": 433}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the wife of the man who was hired to the band without an audition?", "query_id": "27da23433444336c8f16adc342c05e8c17ac86bd", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Deborah"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Deborah", "answer_start": 2217}]}, {"question": "What did the band that debuted at Electric Circus change their name to in 1978?", "query_id": "1b066735e35a04c1ee413002317b308ad81f7b04", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Joy Division"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Joy Division", "answer_start": 2448}]}, {"question": "What novel did the band that changed their name in 1978 have their new name inspired from?", "query_id": "99a1114cc17589f593f68fb346c3b44130333264", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["House of Dolls"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "House of Dolls", "answer_start": 2581}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the debut EP of the band that began with the name Warsaw?", "query_id": "84ed722023b3b4de1e6e58a49c010092906be74a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["An Ideal for Living"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "An Ideal for Living", "answer_start": 2645}]}, {"question": "In what city did the band that got their original name from a David Bowie song perform when they debuted their new name in 1978?", "query_id": "76e1e78caeafb8302bb4b116b68c82b4cb365458", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Manchester"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Manchester", "answer_start": 2906}]}]}, "89122e986ec5a3932aed76469735fe957dc64124": {"passage": "Jane Hoskins has worked most of her life as a lady's maid, and is currently employed by Lord Minden and his haughty wife Lady Sybil Minden.

Having squandered his money, Nigel sneaks into his brother's home and steals Lady Minden's earrings. Lady Minden accuses her maid Jane of the theft until Nigel steps forward and claims responsibility. Jane is angry at being wrongly accused of theft by her employer and decides to quit her job and make her way into high society. \nNigel is impressed by Jane's attitude and, after securing the earrings in return for never bothering his brother again, he offers to take Jane out for an evening of fine dining. Together they unintentionally con a wealthy gentleman into believing that Jane is a wealthy widow, the Lady Lovely, and that she collects donations for a fictional Egyptian charity called The Nile Fund. At the end of the night, one hundred pounds wealthier, Jane makes a business arrangement with Nigel that the two of them should work together as confidence tricksters. \nJane and Nigel travel to Monte Carlo, San Remo and Shanghai, where they cheat at gambling and are repeatedly asked by the authorities to leave the country.

The blaze was caused by the burning of small wooden tally sticks which had been used as part of the accounting procedures of the Exchequer until 1826. The sticks were disposed of carelessly in the two furnaces under the House of Lords, which caused a chimney fire in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords' chamber and up through the walls.\nThe resulting fire spread rapidly throughout the complex and developed into the biggest conflagration in London between the Great Fire of 1666 and the Blitz of the Second World War; the event attracted large crowds which included several artists who provided pictorial records of the event. The fire lasted for most of the night and destroyed a large part of the palace, including the converted St Stephen's Chapel\u2014the meeting place of the House of Commons\u2014the Lords Chamber, the Painted Chamber and the official residences of the Speaker and the Clerk of the House of Commons.\nThe actions of Superintendent James Braidwood of the London Fire Engine Establishment ensured that Westminster Hall and a few other parts of the old Houses of Parliament survived the blaze. In 1836 a competition for designs for a new palace was won by Charles Barry.  Barry's plans, developed in collaboration with Augustus Pugin, incorporated the surviving buildings into the new complex.

In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. \"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work,\" he wrote, adding: \"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.Shackleton's initial reply was accommodating: \"I would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself\". Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. \"I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound\", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided \"what limits he puts on his own rights\". To this Shackleton replied: \"There is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further\".The matter was unresolved when Scott returned from sea duty in May 1907. Scott pressed for a line of demarcation at 170\u00b0 W\u2014everything to the west of that line, including Ross Island, McMurdo Sound, and Victoria Land, would be Scott's preserve. Shackleton, with other concerns pressing on him, felt obliged to concede. On 17 May he signed a declaration stating that \"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\", and that he would seek to land further east, either at the Barrier Inlet visited briefly during the Discovery Expedition, or at King Edward VII Land. He would not touch the coast of Victoria Land at all. It was a capitulation to Scott and Wilson, and meant forfeiting the expedition's aim of reaching the South Magnetic Pole which was located within Victoria Land. Polar historian Beau Riffenburgh believes this was \"a promise that should never ethically have been demanded and one that should never have been given, impacting as it might on the entire safety of Shackleton's expedition\". The dispute soured relations between the two men (who nevertheless maintained public civilities), and would eventually lead to the complete rupture of Shackleton's formerly close friendship with Wilson.In his own account of the expedition Shackleton makes no reference to the wrangle with Scott. He merely states that \"before we finally left England I had decided that if possible I would establish my base in King Edward VII Land instead of [...] McMurdo Sound\".", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod_Expedition", "title": "Nimrod Expedition", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the name of the person who wrote, \"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work\"?", "query_id": "7e0e466f08efa5db6513eafcccabe6a779349c45", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Scott"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Scott", "answer_start": 226}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the person who wrote that \"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\"?", "query_id": "1c10e46852abe9eb5f18236ad45f7c025f16a51e", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Scott"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Scott", "answer_start": 226}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the person whose views Shackleton replied he would like to fall in with as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to himself?", "query_id": "7bf18264abf934e590dc8726da1bc0d79fe730e2", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Scott"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Scott", "answer_start": 226}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the person who signed a declaration stating that \"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\"?", "query_id": "72370f9d67c57a84655fc0a8a6de3c10127e6e7f", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Shackleton"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Shackleton", "answer_start": 1403}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the person to whom Shackleton stated that he is leaving the McMurdo base in a signed declaration?", "query_id": "5f6c3d95d7d8815ae96d693f3678bb6da73f84c4", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Scott"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Scott", "answer_start": 1190}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the person who stated that he would seek to land further east, either at the Barrier Inlet visited briefly during the Discovery Expedition, or at King Edward VII Land?", "query_id": "a5bd17df5ebc7eeeefe35433ad95de1929cbb7f7", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Shackleton"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Shackleton", "answer_start": 1403}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the person who claimed he would not touch the coast of Victoria Land at all?", "query_id": "49adf92e20d676087ad9fb648d17877ba3c3cf2d", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Shackleton"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Shackleton", "answer_start": 1403}]}, {"question": "What are the specific names of the two men between whom the dispute soured relations?", "query_id": "9808e4a56674344351005b808f1b53afc0c07656", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Scott", "Shackleton"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Scott", "answer_start": 1232}, {"text": "Shackleton", "answer_start": 1403}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the person who states that \"before we finally left England I had decided that if possible I would establish my base in King Edward VII Land instead of [...] McMurdo Sound\"?", "query_id": "bebf5b4273d4bad22bbbea3ec18ba516adff23c4", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Shackleton"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Shackleton", "answer_start": 2392}]}]}, "2847396860fdeeeaf2149557933776230697aa55": {"passage": "Huddie Ledbetter leaves his father's house just barely into his twenties and arrives at a brothel on Fannin' Street ran by Miss Eula, who nicknames him Leadbelly and has him play at the bar.

Towering above the village is the estate of Elias Graves, a wealthy man who hopes to use his influence to remove these squatters from his land. When his lawyer is unable to so directly, he instead enacts a ban on net fishing, removing the livelihoods of many people in the village, including Tess and her father.\nDespite the ban, some continue to fish illegally, though they are soon confronted by men sent by Graves. In this confrontation, one of Graves' men is shot and killed. Tess' father is wrongfully accused of the murder and arrested. Meanwhile, through these altercations Tess meets Frederick Graves, Elias' son, who is home on a break from his theological studies. Before long, the two begin a forbidden romance. Also on break with Frederick is Dan Jordan, a friend from his fraternity, who simultaneously falls in love with Frederick's sister, Teola.\nSoon after Dan and Frederick return to college, Teola learns that she is pregnant and struggles to decide if she should tell Dan. Her decision is made for her soon enough, as she receives a letter informing her that Dan has died heroically in a fire at the fraternity. Unable to confide in her very stern father, Teola is distraught and turns to Tess for support. Once the baby is born, Tess agrees to take the child and bear the social stigma of having a child out of wedlock.\nUpon his return, Frederick is forced to shun Tess for her sin despite his remaining love for her. Soon, however, Teola's baby falls ill and Tess decides to take him up to Elias' church to be baptized. Disgusted by Tess and the child, Elias refuses, shaming them publicly. Teola, having witnessed her father's anger, decides to step forward and admit the truth about her child. Tess is forgiven and it is decided that Teola will die with her son.

The following month, he and his family moved to Pl\u00e2s Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: \"Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white \u2013 all over white \u2013 and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything.\" He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, \"My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love.\" Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.Elgar's principal composition in 1905 was the Introduction and Allegro for Strings, dedicated to Samuel Sanford, professor at Yale University. Elgar visited America in that year to conduct his music and to accept a doctorate from Yale. His next large-scale work was the sequel to The Apostles \u2013 the oratorio The Kingdom (1906). It was well received but did not catch the public imagination as The Dream of Gerontius had done and continued to do. Among keen Elgarians, however, The Kingdom was sometimes preferred to the earlier work: Elgar's friend Frank Schuster told the young Adrian Boult: \"compared with The Kingdom, Gerontius is the work of a raw amateur.\" As Elgar approached his fiftieth birthday, he began work on his first symphony, a project that had been in his mind in various forms for nearly ten years. His First Symphony (1908) was a national and international triumph. Within weeks of the premiere it was performed in New York under Walter Damrosch, Vienna under Ferdinand L\u00f6we, St. Petersburg under Alexander Siloti, and Leipzig under Arthur Nikisch. There were performances in Rome, Chicago, Boston, Toronto and fifteen British towns and cities.

At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world.

In 1985, the first part of the Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.The earliest parts of Ashton Town Hall, which was the first purpose-built town hall in what is now Tameside, date to 1840 when it was opened. It has classical features such as the Corinthian columns on the entrance facade. Enlarged in 1878, the hall provides areas for administrative purposes and public functions. Meanwhile, the Old Street drill hall was completed in 1887.\nThere are five parks in the town, three of which have Green Flag Awards. The first park opened in Ashton-under-Lyne was Stamford Park on the border with Stalybridge. The park opened in 1873, following a 17-year campaign by local cotton workers; the land was bought from a local mill-owner for \u00a315,000 (\u00a31.4 million as of 2019) and further land was donated by George Grey, 7th Earl of Stamford. A crowd of between 60,000 and 80,000 turned out to see the Earl of Stamford formally open the new facility on 12 July 1873. It now includes a boating lake, and a memorial to Joseph Rayner Stephens, commissioned by local factory workers to commemorate his work promoting fair wages and improved working conditions. A conservatory was opened in 1907, and Coronation gates installed at both the Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge entrances in 1953.Hartshead Pike is a stone tower on top of Hartshead Hill overlooking Ashton and Oldham.

From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian humanist scholar Polydore Vergil was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the choir of the cathedral. While Wells survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. Medieval brasses were sold, and a pulpit was placed in the nave for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a herb garden, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.Elizabeth I gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailor, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair.

These are toothed gears that are driven from the rotation of the main drill motor via 45\u00b0 spiral gears; their axis of rotation is horizontal, and they are placed so that the teeth cut four vertical slots in the borehole wall.  Guide fins higher on the sonde travel in these slots and provide the antitorque.  The design was effective at preventing rotation of the sonde, but it proved to be almost impossible to realign the guide fins with the existing slots when tripping in.  Misalignment increased the chance of the drill getting stuck in the borehole; and there was also a risk of ice cuttings from the mill cutters jamming in between the drill and the borehole wall, causing the drill to get stuck.  The system was used again in a drill developed in China in the 1980s and 1990s, but the problems inherent in the design are now considered insuperable and it is no longer in use.The most recent anti-torque system design is the use of U-shaped blades, made of steel and fixed vertically to the sides of the sonde.  Initial implementations ran into problems with thin blades bending too easily, and thick blades providing too much resistance to vertical movement of the sonde, but the final design can generate strong resistance to torque in both firn and ice.Drills may be designed with more than one anti-torque system in order to take advantage of the different performance of the different designs in different kinds of snow and ice.  For example, a drill may have skates to be used in hard firn or ice, but also have a leaf-spring system, which will be more effective in soft firn.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_drilling", "title": "Ice drilling", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What are the initials for the group that designed several drills using side-mill cutters?", "query_id": "d4adb4685ab5c303e6dd23625362363eb951ce33", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["JARE"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "JARE", "answer_start": 58}]}]}, "a7e96a3a9e36986db834911b427ecae66ad75cc4": {"passage": "Imogen Clare Holst  (n\u00e9e von Holst; 12 April 1907 \u2013 9 March 1984) was a British composer, arranger, conductor, teacher, musicologist, and festival administrator. The only child of the composer Gustav Holst, she is particularly known for her educational work at Dartington Hall in the 1940s, and for her 20 years as joint artistic director of the Aldeburgh Festival. In addition to composing music, she wrote composer biographies, much educational material, and several books on the life and works of her father.\nFrom a young age, Holst showed precocious talent in composing and performance. After attending Eothen School and St Paul's Girls' School, she entered the Royal College of Music, where she developed her skills as a conductor and won several prizes for composing. Unable for health reasons to follow her initial ambitions to be a pianist or a dancer, Holst spent most of the 1930s teaching, and as a full-time organiser for the English Folk Dance and Song Society. These duties reduced her compositional activities, although she made many arrangements of folksongs. After serving as an organiser for the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts at the start of the Second World War, in 1942 she began working at Dartington. In her nine years there she established Dartington as a major centre of music education and activity.\nIn the early 1950s Holst became Benjamin Britten's musical assistant, moved to Aldeburgh, and began helping with the organisation of the annual Aldeburgh Festival. In 1956 she became joint artistic director of the festival, and during the following 20 years helped it to a position of pre-eminence in British musical life. In 1964 she gave up her work as Britten's assistant, to resume her own compositional career and to concentrate on the preservation of her father's musical legacy. Her own music is not widely known and has received little critical attention; much of it is unpublished and unperformed. The first recordings dedicated to her works, issued in 2009 and 2012, were warmly received by critics. She was appointed CBE in 1975 and received numerous academic honours.

Pepper was the first major pop/rock LP to include its complete lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album was the subject of a scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were \"listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy\". Poirier identified what he termed its \"mixed allusiveness\": \"It's unwise ever to assume that they're doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style ... one kind of feeling about a subject isn't enough ... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives.\" McCartney said at the time: \"We write songs. We know what we mean by them. But in a week someone else says something about it, and you can't deny it. ... You put your own meaning at your own level to our songs.\" The album's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their \"brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms\" as a knowingly \"anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment\" display. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it number one on its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".\nOn 25 June 1967, the Beatles performed their forthcoming single, \"All You Need Is Love\", to an estimated 350 million viewers on Our World, the first live global television link. Released a week later, during the Summer of Love, the song was adopted as a flower power anthem. Two months later, the group suffered a loss that threw their career into turmoil. Having been introduced to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi only the previous night in London, on 25 August they travelled to Bangor for his Transcendental Meditation retreat. Two days later, their manager's assistant, Peter Brown, phoned to inform them that Epstein, only thirty-two years old, had died. The coroner ruled the death an accidental carbitol overdose, although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide. Epstein had been in a fragile emotional state, stressed by personal troubles. His death left the group disoriented and fearful about the future. Lennon recalled: \"We collapsed. I knew that we were in trouble then.

The deal was reportedly for \u00a31 million. After signing with Syco, Johnston made public appearances, including performing at Andrew Lloyd Webber's birthday celebrations on 14 September, and at Carlisle United's Brunton Park.Johnston's debut album, One Voice, was released on 29 September 2008. It includes a cover of \"Walking in the Air\", performed with Faryl Smith. The album was recorded over a six-week period in London, and the track listing was chosen by Cowell. Johnston described the recording process as \"brilliant\", and that it was \"really good \u2013 just to be in a recording studio and meet the different people\". The album debuted in the British charts at number five, and finished the week at number four. The album was later certified gold, having sold 100,000 copies, and Johnston was presented a gold disc by daytime television presenter Penny Smith. Critics responded positively to the album, with Kate Leaver, writing for the Korea JoongAng Daily, saying Johnston \"has truer talent than hordes of his musical elders\" and that \"the vulnerability\" of Johnston's performance on the album \"makes for a haunting musical experience\". In Music Week, the album was described as \"highly-anticipated\", and Johnston was called \"exceptionally-talented\".After the album's release, Johnston became involved in the Sing Up campaign, appearing in schools around the country to encourage other young people to join choirs. In December 2008, Johnston made a guest appearance at Whitehaven's Christmas fair, and performed at a carol service in Bradford. Johnston was also invited to turn on the Carlisle Christmas lights and perform at the celebrations.

Asked about how she approached her art, she stated:\nMy work is about structure and order. It is a pursuit of a kind of logic: a formal, sculptural logic and poetic logic. It is a conceptual and physical process of building and taking away at the same time. I set out to strip the ideas and associations down to (physically and metaphorically) just the bones, exposing the life still held inside.\nWhile Oliver was reluctant to discuss meaning in her works, critics have identified recurring themes. Hannah Fink, like art critic John McDonald, noted that there is a pattern to the shapes and structures in Oliver's work. Fink described this as \"a consistent vocabulary of elemental forms \u2013 the spiral, meander, loop and sphere \u2013 in a repertoire of signature archetypes\". McDonald said that Nature is \"omnipresent\" and referred to them as organisms or their remains.Despite their organic appearance, Oliver's own view was that her work was not grounded in nature's structures.  Nevertheless, critics have identified the lifelike qualities of early pieces that resembled shells, claws or tails, or noted the apparent similarities to biological forms. McDonald commented that \"For Oliver to deny nature is akin to Balthus saying there is nothing erotic about his paintings or Rothko claiming his works aren't abstract.\" Both major reviews of Oliver's work (Fenner's 1995 essay and Fink's 2002 journal article) draw attention to dualism and contradiction in the sculptures: Fenner describes them as \"delicate and ephemeral, [yet] structurally robust and durable\"; Fink sees them as \"ethereal but solid, fluid yet rigid, open but closed\".Oliver's sculptures are admired for their tactile nature, their aesthetics, and the technical skills demonstrated in their production.\nParticular works have been singled out for praise. A writer reviewing Vine in the Sydney Hilton admired how it \"curls like a fairy tale beanstalk up towards the ceiling as though empowered by the sunlight streaming in from a large open space adjacent\". Journalist Catherine Keenan's 2005 description of how the towering sculpture demonstrated both aesthetic and production values are typical of comments about Oliver's work:\nIt has the delicate, adamantine beauty that characterises many of her pieces, but is also an engineering marvel: 380 kilograms of metal that was delivered on the back of an oversized truck and now hangs from a single specially manufactured rod fixed to the ceiling.\nThe Sydney Morning Herald's art writer, John McDonald, said of her work \"It often seems to me she's only got one tune, but it's a pretty good tune\".

In 1919\u20131920 Lissitzky was a head of Architectural department at the People's Art School where with his students, primarily Lazar Khidekel, he was working on transition from plane to volumetric suprematism. Lissitzky designed On the New System of Art by Malevich, who responded in December 1919: \"Lazar Markovich, I salute you on the publication of this little book\". Perhaps the most famous work by Lissitzky from the same period was the 1919 propaganda poster \"Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge\". Russia was going through a civil war at the time, which was mainly fought between the \"Reds\" (communists, socialists and revolutionaries) and the \"Whites\" (monarchists, conservatives, liberals and other socialists who opposed the Bolshevik Revolution). The image of the red wedge shattering the white form, simple as it was, communicated a powerful message that left no doubt in the viewer's mind of its intention. The piece is often seen as alluding to the similar shapes used on military maps and, along with its political symbolism, was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism into a style his own. He stated: \"The artist constructs a new symbol with his brush. This symbol is not a recognizable form of anything that is already finished, already made, or already existent in the world \u2013 it is a symbol of a new world, which is being built upon and which exists by the way of the people.\"In January 17, 1920, Malevich and Lissitzky co-founded the short-lived Molposnovis (Young followers of a new art), a proto-suprematist association of students, professors, and other artists. After a brief and stormy dispute between \"old\" and \"young\" generations, and two rounds of renaming, the group reemerged as UNOVIS (Exponents of the new art) in February. Under the leadership of Malevich the group worked on a \"suprematist ballet\", choreographed by Nina Kogan and on the remake of a 1913 futurist opera Victory Over the Sun by Mikhail Matyushin and Aleksei Kruchenykh. Lissitzky and the entire group chose to share credit and responsibility for the works produced within the group, signing most pieces with a black square. This was partly a homage to a similar piece by their leader, Malevich, and a symbolic embrace of the Communist ideal. This would become the de facto seal of UNOVIS that took the place of individual names or initials. Black squares worn by members as chest badges and cufflinks also resembled the ritual tefillin and thus were no strange symbol in Vitebsk shtetl.The group, which disbanded in 1922, would be pivotal in the dissemination of suprematist ideology in Russia and abroad and launch Lissitzky's status as one of the leading figures in the avant garde. Incidentally, the earliest appearance of the signature Lissitzky (Russian: \u042d\u043b\u044c \u041b\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439) emerged in the handmade UNOVIS Miscellany, issued in two copies in March\u2013April 1920, and containing his manifesto on book art: \"the book enters the skull through the eye not the ear therefore the pathways the waves move at much greater speed and with more intensity. if i (sic) can only sing through my mouth with a book i (sic) can show myself in various guises.\"", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Lissitzky", "title": "El Lissitzky", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Who worked on transition from plane to volumetric suprematism?", "query_id": "f4f06b7fd6fee058d09db324ca324af092386d58", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Lissitzky"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Lissitzky", "answer_start": 14}]}, {"question": "What is often seen as alluding to the similar shapes used on military maps?", "query_id": "bfbffe3db8c5f9174a32272181508825191a2bb5", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge", "answer_start": 593}]}, {"question": "What was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism?", "query_id": "e37cc7094ab8caf269d6fbf29e3442308f5ea9f4", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge", "answer_start": 593}]}, {"question": "Who stated \"the artist constructs a new symbol with his brush\"?", "query_id": "6c2f8cace77dc6d382a111e99fb220cd70dc7f39", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Lissitzky"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Lissitzky", "answer_start": 1177}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the group that worked under the leadership of Malevich on a \"suprematist ballet,\" choreographed by Nina Kogan, after going through two rounds of renaming?", "query_id": "42eea52be736bf5c04ab29ba82b4a8215c4247f4", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["UNOVIS"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "UNOVIS", "answer_start": 1879}]}]}, "162fe017edcf93c9ae26c4329d2c631e1a3c30d0": {"passage": "Gustav Theodore Holst (born Gustavus Theodore von Holst; 21 September 1874 \u2013 25 May 1934) was an English composer, arranger and teacher. Best known for his orchestral suite The Planets, he composed a large number of other works across a range of genres, although none achieved comparable success. His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss being most crucial early in his development. The subsequent inspiration of the English folksong revival of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as Maurice Ravel, led Holst to develop and refine an individual style.\nThere were professional musicians in the previous three generations of Holst's family and it was clear from his early years that he would follow the same calling. He hoped to become a pianist, but was prevented by neuritis in his right arm. Despite his father's reservations, he pursued a career as a composer, studying at the Royal College of Music under Charles Villiers Stanford. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the trombone professionally and later became a teacher\u2014a great one, according to his colleague Ralph Vaughan Williams. Among other teaching activities he built up a strong tradition of performance at Morley College, where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924, and pioneered music education for women at St Paul's Girls' School, where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of Whitsun music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.\nHolst's works were played frequently in the early years of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of The Planets in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame, and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined.

In February 1939, the Paris Group showed that when fission occurs in uranium, two or three extra neutrons are given off. This important observation suggested that a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction might be possible. The term \"atomic bomb\" was already familiar to the British public through the writings of H. G. Wells, in his 1913 novel The World Set Free. It was immediately apparent to many scientists that, in theory at least, an extremely powerful explosive could be created, although most still considered an atomic bomb was an impossibility. Perrin defined a critical mass of uranium to be the smallest amount that could sustain a chain reaction. The neutrons used to cause fission in uranium are considered slow neutrons, but when neutrons are released during a fission reaction they are released as fast neutrons which have much more speed and energy. Thus, in order to create a sustained chain reaction, there existed a need for a neutron moderator to contain and slow the fast neutrons until they reached a usable energy level. The College de France found that both water and graphite could be used as acceptable moderators.Early in 1940, the Paris Group decided on theoretical grounds that heavy water would be an ideal moderator for how they intended to use it. They asked the French Minister of Armaments to obtain as much heavy water as possible from the only source, the large Norsk Hydro hydroelectric station at Vemork in Norway. The French then discovered that Germany had already offered to purchase the entire stock of Norwegian heavy water, indicating that Germany might also be researching an atomic bomb. The French told the Norwegian government of the possible military significance of heavy water. Norway gave the entire stock of 187 litres (41 imp gal; 49 US gal) to a Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau agent, who secretly brought it to France just before Germany invaded Norway in April 1940. On 19 June 1940, following the German invasion of France, it was shipped to England by the Earl of Suffolk and Major Ardale Golding, aboard the steamer Broompark. The heavy water, valued at \u00a322,000, was initially kept at HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs, and was later secretly stored in the library at Windsor Castle.

In Hungary, the reformist Imre Nagy replaced R\u00e1kosi, \"Stalin's Best Hungarian Disciple\", as Prime Minister. However, R\u00e1kosi remained General Secretary of the Party, and was able to undermine most of Nagy's reforms. By April 1955, he had Nagy discredited and removed from office. After Khrushchev's \"secret speech\" of February 1956, which denounced Stalin and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, R\u00e1kosi was deposed as General Secretary of the Party and replaced by Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151 on 18 July 1956. Radio Free Europe (RFE) broadcast the \"secret speech\" to Eastern Europe on the advice of Ray S. Cline, who saw it as a way to, \"as I think I told [Allen Dulles] to say, 'indict the whole Soviet system'.\"On 14 May 1955, the Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact, binding Hungary to the Soviet Union and its satellite states in Central and Eastern Europe. Among the principles of this alliance were \"respect for the independence and sovereignty of states\" and \"non-interference in their internal affairs\".In 1955, the Austrian State Treaty and ensuing declaration of neutrality established Austria as a demilitarised and neutral country. This raised Hungarian hopes of also becoming neutral and in 1955 Nagy had considered \"the possibility of Hungary adopting a neutral status on the Austrian pattern\".In June 1956, a violent uprising by Polish workers in Pozna\u0144 was put down by the government, with scores of protesters killed and wounded. Responding to popular demand, in October 1956, the government appointed the recently rehabilitated reformist communist W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka as First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, with a mandate to negotiate trade concessions and troop reductions with the Soviet government. After a few tense days of negotiations, on 19 October the Soviets finally gave in to Gomu\u0142ka's reformist demands. News of the concessions won by the Poles, known as Polish October, emboldened many Hungarians to hope for similar concessions for Hungary and these sentiments contributed significantly to the highly charged political climate that prevailed in Hungary in the second half of October 1956.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956", "title": "Hungarian Revolution of 1956", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the first name of the person who was denounced in Khrushchev's speech?", "query_id": "5feab5de8afd1e14e987666bfdd1189fe56f997c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Joseph"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Joseph", "answer_start": 17}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who was removed from office by April of 1955??", "query_id": "097863dd6486b59e9522d84acbecf3610e35ba2a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Imre"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Imre", "answer_start": 174}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who discredited Nagy and remove her from office?", "query_id": "ae519403fccf56e2ee90692df91ae0f04bca3435", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["R\u00e1kosi"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "R\u00e1kosi", "answer_start": 265}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who had considered \"the possibility of Hungary adopting a neutral status on the Austrian pattern?\"", "query_id": "189ceedf5e533d3c0be1ce8c202fcf5565b21577", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Imre"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Imre", "answer_start": 174}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person the Soviets finally gave in to on 19 October", "query_id": "bd9e500dad246d0c835d6d06b5a1fc24d55a83aa", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["W\u0142adys\u0142aw"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "W\u0142adys\u0142aw", "answer_start": 1674}]}]}, "df5737e90337cbf5c85339f586288c3d1d43cd5e": {"passage": "The Beatles' 1, a compilation album of the band's British and American number-one hits, was released on 13 November 2000.

As of April 2009, the compilation had sold 31 million copies globally, and is the best-selling album of that decade in the United States.Harrison died from metastatic lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr were among the musicians who performed at the Concert for George, organised by Eric Clapton and Harrison's widow, Olivia. The tribute event took place at the Royal Albert Hall on the first anniversary of Harrison's death.In 2003, Let It Be... Naked, a reconceived version of the Let It Be album, with McCartney supervising production, was released. One of the main differences from the Spector-produced version was the omission of the original string arrangements. It was a top ten hit in both Britain and America. The US album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006; The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 and Volume 2 included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of the music's original American release.As a soundtrack for Cirque du Soleil's Las Vegas Beatles stage revue, Love, George Martin and his son Giles remixed and blended 130 of the band's recordings to create what Martin called \"a way of re-living the whole Beatles musical lifespan in a very condensed period\".

They were neither fought over nor the locus of battles (with the exception of the Dakota War of 1862), and although hazardous at times, other trails presented greater dangers. It may be that this relative lack of attention is due to the fact they did not lead to annexation of any territory to either of the nations in which the trails were located.The trails nevertheless were instrumental in the development of central North America. Traffic over the West Plains Trail sustained the Selkirk Settlement in its early years. The trails also gave settlers of that colony and their M\u00e9tis neighbours a route for migration as well as a highway for trade that was not dependent on the Hudson's Bay Company. As usage grew, old fur trading posts became settlements and new communities were established along the cart routes.  The trails pioneered by the fur brigades accelerated development of Minnesota and North Dakota, and facilitated settlement of the Canadian northwest.\nThe trails had profound political effects during a time of Anglo-American tension. Both Britain and the U.S. were concerned about each other's cross-border influences. Born out of commercial needs and located by the dictates of geography, the trails helped create and contribute to these international influences and the tensions which resulted. The United States sent military expeditions along the route of the trails to assert national interests in the face of the continued British presence in the northwestern fur posts on soil which the U.S. claimed. The Americans were also concerned about the establishment of Lord Selkirk's colony as well as British claims to the Red River Valley. Finally the U.S. wanted to curtail Britain's attempts to get access to the Mississippi, access implicit in the Treaty of Paris ending the American War of Independence, and which Britain sought into the nineteenth century.  The United States' assertion of dominion over its new territories parried and reversed the British domination of the fur trade in the upper Mississippi valley, which had continued for decades after the Revolutionary War settlement which had assigned those territories to the new nation.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_Trails", "title": "Red River Trails", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What were neither fought over nor the locus of battles?", "query_id": "a5796f0f2cfbeabab8f550045e52e23ebec2f03d", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["The Red River Trails"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "The Red River Trails", "answer_start": 0}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the acronym U.S.?", "query_id": "a434fda2705a16faaf37953c35eff148d0c5f5c0", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["United States"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "United States", "answer_start": 1571}]}, {"question": "What is the acronym for the United States?", "query_id": "2efd61585b94625d916d65e66ced1c25a27a7686", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["U.S."]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "U.S.", "answer_start": 1325}]}]}, "5a5eae2d9e2a16a2188d6465ae318d56f0cc7c74": {"passage": "Former Division I collegiate wrestler Scott Voss is a 42-year-old bored and disillusioned biology teacher at the failing Wilkinson High School.

When Scott arrives at Niko's apartment, he learns that Niko was a former mixed martial arts fighter.  While watching the UFC at Niko's apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives $10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA.\nScott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only $750 to the loser.  Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out an opponent and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his $48,000 goal. While Mark trains with Scott, Malia De La Cruz, one of Scott's students and a band member, helps Niko study for his citizenship test by putting the information into songs.

Messages could have been relayed between these three points within minutes. On the mesa behind Chaco Canyon is an ancient road that runs north from Chetro Ketl, then northward along the east side of Pueblo Alto before joining with the Great North Road. The Pueblo Alto road network functioned between 1050 and 1140. It facilitated access to watering holes, terraced farming areas, and enabled interaction between Pueblo Alto and great houses like Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl. It also led to a community along Escavada Wash. It may have served an important function in the transport of household goods, construction timber, and people throughout the San Juan Basin. Several road segments appear to be related to a row of Chetro Ketl's exterior rooms, which are thought to have been community storage space.In 1982 Robert Powers theorized that the road network \"suggests an intercommunity organization and settlement system of regional extent\". Because \"Chaco Canyon is the convergence point of all presently documented extra-canyon roads\", the area may represent a locus of regional control, or \"the apex of the hierarchical system\". Powers believes that great houses like Chetro Ketl were involved in civic coordination between the canyon sites and outlying communities. In 1993 David R. Wilcox proposed that a state-level society developed at Chaco, with an administrative center at Pueblo Bonito or Chetro Ketl. In a 2003 study of Chacoan artifacts, Frances Joan Mathien stated that the number of warrior-class individuals that would have been needed to support such a state \u2013 Wilcox estimated 500\u20131,000 \u2013 precludes his theory, and Wilcox is assuming a \"greater Chacoan organizational complexity than any other scholar to date\".Lekson developed a theory called the Chaco Meridian, which is based on architectural similarities between the Ancestral Puebloan sites at Aztec Ruins and Chaco Canyon, and Paquime at Casas Grandes in northern Mexico. He believes the sites were intentionally located on the same approximate line of longitude (107\u00b057'25\"), and this indicates a ceremonial connection between them. The Great North Road roughly follows the Chaco Meridian, and many of the ancient roads in the area appear to follow it towards key sites in the basin.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chetro_Ketl", "title": "Chetro Ketl", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Who believes there is a ceremonial connection between the Ancestral Puebloan sites and Paquime a Casas Grandes in northern Mexico?", "query_id": "5eeb2f48daa765f6a3756549295657668329bbf1", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Lekson"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Lekson", "answer_start": 1977}]}, {"question": "Whose theory did Frances Joan Mathien believe was precluded by the number of warrior-class individuals needed to support a state?", "query_id": "13be8caf5dfe10e17564cc8c678a466cf31e138d", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["David R.

A white Jesuit priest assisting in desegregation negotiations attested the \"demonstrations [were] poorly timed and misdirected\".Protest organizers knew they would meet with violence from the Birmingham Police Department and chose a confrontational approach to get the attention of the federal government. Wyatt Tee Walker, one of the SCLC founders and the executive director from 1960 to 1964, planned the tactics of the direct action protests, specifically targeting Bull Connor's tendency to react to demonstrations with violence: \"My theory was that if we mounted a strong nonviolent movement, the opposition would surely do something to attract the media, and in turn induce national sympathy and attention to the everyday segregated circumstance of a person living in the Deep South.\" He headed the planning of what he called Project C, which stood for \"confrontation\". Organizers believed their phones were tapped, so to prevent their plans from being leaked and perhaps influencing the mayoral election, they used code words for demonstrations.The plan called for direct nonviolent action to attract media attention to \"the biggest and baddest city of the South\". In preparation for the protests, Walker timed the walking distance from the 16th Street Baptist Church, headquarters for the campaign, to the downtown area.

It depicts a defeated soldier, kneeling in front of another soldier. The defeated fighter strains to free himself from the grip of the victorious warrior, who stands, raising a sword. A kneeling woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier, raising her face to him to beg him to spare his defeated foe. The defeated warrior has a stronger body, a face more in keeping with the conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness. The vanquished soldier's sword has broken, and lies beside him on the ground.Etty did not base The Combat on any single incident from history or literature, or on any existing artwork, but on his own imagination; this was a highly unusual step to take regarding history paintings, which generally depicted themes from literature or religion. He had been considering the topic as early as 1821, and his plans took shape following his visit to Italy. During this visit Etty had met Antonio Canova and been very impressed by him; The Combat is clearly influenced by his work. As well as drawing inspiration from classical sculpture, he was also strongly influenced by the composition of Old Master works he had seen while in Italy. As with many of Etty's works, the models posed for him separately in his studio, rather than as a group.Etty, writing in 1849, described the purpose of The Combat as \"to paint a great moral on the heart [of] the beauty of mercy.\" Etty's 1958 biographer Dennis Farr points out similarities in the composition of The Combat and John Flaxman's drawing Heracles Killing a Man to whom a Woman Clings, but while Etty and Flaxman were contemporaries at the Royal Academy, it is not known if Etty was aware of this drawing.\nIn the initial oil study for the defeated warrior (York Art Gallery), Etty gave the character a more defiant appearance than seen in the finished version. In this preliminary sketch he is not on his knees, but thrusts his leg out to brace himself. He has an expression of defiance and determination, rather than the plea for mercy and posture of total defeat shown in the final work.The completed The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1825.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Combat:_Woman_Pleading_for_the_Vanquished", "title": "The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the full name of the person Etty met in Italy?", "query_id": "7c1d95600791acb3d3b09bd66fbb2f43056c9fc6", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Antonio Canova"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Antonio Canova", "answer_start": 1383}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person Etty had been very impressed by?", "query_id": "3cb605646a85ae4f115c30b31ba2466ebba6bae1", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Canova"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Canova", "answer_start": 1391}]}, {"question": "What was the last name of Etty's biographer?", "query_id": "2a1876ba6a640d125340013d0b1121716e188bb2", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Farr"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Farr", "answer_start": 1892}]}, {"question": "What were the last names of the two people who were contemporaries at the Royal Academy?", "query_id": "9040c593b70c74cc421e64cb836c6d878bbf2d33", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Etty", "Flaxman"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Etty", "answer_start": 2038}, {"text": "Flaxman", "answer_start": 2047}]}]}, "7911c8fa916eb94231c1e1900ecc58875202b1af": {"passage": "It is implied that, in the future, all plant life on Earth has become extinct.

This followed NIST's August 21, 2008, draft report which included a period for public comments, and was followed in 2012 by a peer-reviewed summary in the Journal of Structural Engineering. In its investigation, NIST utilized ANSYS to model events leading up to collapse initiation and LS-DYNA models to simulate the global response to the initiating events. NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role, nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the Twin Towers or the transfer elements (trusses, girders, and cantilever overhangs). The lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, column 79 buckled \u2013 pulling the east penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall downward as a single unit. The fires, which were fueled by office contents and burned for 7 hours, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse. Incidentally, this made the old 7 WTC the only steel skyscraper at the time to have collapsed from fire.When 7 WTC collapsed, debris caused substantial damage and contamination to the Borough of Manhattan Community College's Fiterman Hall building, located adjacent at 30 West Broadway, to the extent that the building was not salvageable. A revised plan called for demolition in 2009 and completion of the new Fiterman Hall in 2012, at a cost of $325 million.

Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album\u2014\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.\nBlonde on Blonde completed the trilogy of rock albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, starting with Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited. Critics often rank Blonde on Blonde as one of the greatest albums of all time. Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a modernist literary sensibility, the album's songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically, while featuring lyrics one critic called \"a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial\". It was one of the first double albums in rock music.\nThe album peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, where it eventually was certified double platinum, and it reached number three in the UK. Blonde on Blonde spawned two singles that were top-twenty hits in the US: \"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\" and \"I Want You\". Two additional songs\u2014\"Just Like a Woman\" and \"Visions of Johanna\"\u2014have been named as among Dylan's greatest compositions and were featured in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blonde_on_Blonde", "title": "Blonde on Blonde", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the first name of the person whose live backing band was the Hawks?", "query_id": "02082968742aac7daee1de7087abcde8a4e4c60f", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Bob"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Bob", "answer_start": 75}]}, {"question": "What are the first names of the three people who moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee?", "query_id": "4fc91f7d83e11374ed5efbdac9e6d2b6b6c8d529", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Bob", "Al", "Robbie"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Bob", "answer_start": 75}, {"text": "Al", "answer_start": 482}, {"text": "Robbie", "answer_start": 507}]}]}, "a7c838156e7f12c47cc0028842dcdc8f5a1af127": {"passage": "The cuisine of Rwanda is based on local staple foods produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as m\u00e9lange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and urwagwa,  made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, M\u00fctzig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra.

In February 1862, Rossier was again in Shanghai, where he sold his cameras and other photographic equipment before embarking for Europe. During his time in Asia it is possible that Rossier photographed in India; Negretti and Zambra issued a series of views of India at about the same time as Rossier's China views.Rossier returned to Switzerland in early 1862 and, in October 1865, married Catharine Barbe Kaelin (1843\u20131867). The couple had a son, Christophe Marie Pierre Joseph, who was born on 30 July 1866. Catharine died on 4 April 1867.\nRossier maintained a photographic studio in Fribourg until at least 1876 and he also had a studio in Einsiedeln. During the 1860s and 1870s, he produced a number of stereographs and cartes-de-visite comprising portraits and views of Fribourg, Einsiedeln and other places in Switzerland. An 1871 advertisement in the French-language Fribourg newspaper La Libert\u00e9 offered photographs by Rossier of religious paintings by the artist Melchior Paul von Deschwanden. In 1872, Rossier applied for a passport to travel to France where he may have produced photographs. At some point between 1871 and 1884, he married again. His second wife, Marie Virginie Overney, was employed as a household servant by the landlords of his studio. They had a son, Joseph Louis, who was born in Paris on 16 March 1884, and who went on to own a caf\u00e9 in Vevey, Switzerland. He died in 1927.\nPierre Rossier died in Paris some time between 1883 and 1898.Examples of Rossier's views of Switzerland are held in several institutions and private collections in that country. Rossier took the first commercial photographs of China and Japan, and they are now quite rare. He complained at times of the adverse effects of the climate on his photographic chemicals and some of his negatives may have been damaged en route to London from Asia. Though his surviving images are scarce, his importance to the early history of photography in Asia is great. Before his arrival in Japan in 1859, Japanese students of photography had struggled to produce satisfactory images, but Rossier's experience, instruction, and contacts with suppliers of photographic materials were extremely helpful in the development of an autonomous photographic tradition in Japan.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Rossier", "title": "Pierre Rossier", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What was the full name of the person who died on 4 April 1867?", "query_id": "d90d0e41b76c76e09a909325383e84311221c79a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Catharine Barbe Kaelin"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Catharine Barbe Kaelin", "answer_start": 715}]}, {"question": "What was the first name of the person Rossier married?", "query_id": "5c897bca753b80cc453b9d62b5df850f032b8f74", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Catharine"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Catharine", "answer_start": 715}]}, {"question": "What was the first name of the person born on 30 July 1866?", "query_id": "e57bcd706110039cb031b552f4ce82b4cbfb4762", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Christophe"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Christophe", "answer_start": 773}]}, {"question": "What were the last names of the couple who had a son?", "query_id": "7e1f3aeb58f7c4253b51cb0293c21f2643a0439b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Kaelin", "Rossier"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Kaelin", "answer_start": 731}, {"text": "Rossier", "answer_start": 639}]}, {"question": "What were the two locations where Rossier had a studio?", "query_id": "87127024162f7594b7c8c49f25833e88a5fc157b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Fribourg", "Einsiedeln"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Fribourg", "answer_start": 911}, {"text": "Einsiedeln", "answer_start": 968}]}, {"question": "What was the full name of the person who was employed as a household servant by the landlords of his studio?", "query_id": "801087ed1cf158b450f21ec33cbdb77aceef58a3", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Marie Virginie Overney"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Marie Virginie Overney", "answer_start": 1500}]}, {"question": "What was the first name of Rossier's second wife?", "query_id": "3bf2f7017d43152b8f37bd77549671cb9181205e", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Marie"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Marie", "answer_start": 1500}]}, {"question": "What was the full name of the person who married Marie Virginie Overney?", "query_id": "1b1ac555ad7310c2aa17710322fa9f881d8584ad", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Pierre Rossier"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Pierre Rossier", "answer_start": 1732}]}, {"question": "What was the first name of the person who died in Paris between 1883 and 1898?", "query_id": "b5076d763436a18c25ad093426ada1633ab7ba2c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Pierre"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Pierre", "answer_start": 1732}]}, {"question": "What was the full name of the person who dies in 1927?", "query_id": "bbd53454774d927311a7b5b63614667a71fdfe43", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Joseph Louis"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Joseph Louis", "answer_start": 1608}]}]}, "b3a94d78bde9d2fa1972eccc42e1eaabf2235936": {"passage": "Prose works in Sanskrit was prolific during this era as well.

He became a nationally renowned designer of war memorials following his work as an adviser to (and later one of the principal architects for) the Imperial War Graves Commission and his design for the Cenotaph on London's Whitehall. As well as dozens of public war memorials in towns and cities across Britain, Lutyens designed several private memorials to individual casualties, usually the sons of friends or clients. Many were heirs to the country houses Lutyens had built earlier in his career, as in Mells where he renovated the manor at the beginning of the 20th century. His work in Mells arose through his friend and collaborator Gertrude Jekyll, who introduced him to the Horners through a family connection. Lutyens established a friendship which led to multiple commissions in the village. In addition to his work on the manor, he redesigned its gardens and worked on several related buildings and structures, and after the war was responsible for a tribute to Raymond Asquith (Edward's brother-in-law), also located in St Andrew's Church, and the village war memorial. Lutyens designed two other memorials to Horner: a wooden board featuring a description of the events leading up to his death, which was placed on a wall in the family chapel in St Andrew's Church; and a stone tablet in Cambrai Cathedral.Alfred Munnings was a painter specialising in horses. He volunteered for military service at the outbreak of war but was deemed unfit due to lack of sight in one eye. He volunteered to tend to army horses and was later recruited as a civilian war artist attached to Canadian cavalry. In 1919, he was beginning to move into sculpture. The Horner memorial was his first public work of sculpture, for which Lutyens commissioned him based on a pre-existing friendship. The work led to several further commissions for equine statues, including from the Jockey Club for a sculpture of the racehorse Brown Jack at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Munnings produced two models in clay for review by Lady Horner; he worked from photographs provided by Lady Horner and a live model in producing the statue. At one point, Munnings was so dissatisfied with the statue's head that he cut it off and re-cast it from scratch.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrian_statue_of_Edward_Horner", "title": "Equestrian statue of Edward Horner", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What is the first name of the person who established a friendship which led to multiple commissions in the village?", "query_id": "8b20ca1c6257e569b651ff4ecc266ff5bc82f541", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Edwin"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Edwin", "answer_start": 4}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the person Edwin developed a friendship with which led to multiple commissions in the village?", "query_id": "c220a39cb5fdf91b1ca2bc36c935b0aae7723e0b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Horners", "Horner"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Horners", "answer_start": 772}, {"text": "Horner", "answer_start": 1212}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who designed two other memorials to the person Jekyll introduced him to??", "query_id": "dca192b3084c5eb6cd145f7bee550a5d10d7871b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Edwin"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Edwin", "answer_start": 4}]}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person who had a memorial that was a wooden board featuring a description of the events leading up to his death?", "query_id": "8eb7aab616a20d9954a60a9a5e586144571b2530", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Horner"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Horner", "answer_start": 772}]}, {"question": "What was the first name of the person who volunteered for military service at the outbreak of war?", "query_id": "af748dab24e730b09792788cc0368985fcd52ba4", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Alfred"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Alfred", "answer_start": 1409}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who was deemed unfit for military service due to lack of sight in one eye?", "query_id": "bf63950ec984d0ce98ba5b2de667fc34c205198b", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Alfred"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Alfred", "answer_start": 1409}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the painter who had lost his sight in one eye?", "query_id": "66b3ce3017d4f3519e03034791a7a396ad95fd05", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Alfred"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Alfred", "answer_start": 1409}]}, {"question": "What is the first name of the person who volunteered to tend to army horses?", "query_id": "95207e05126e7f54d1d59a849c15204f2fcec012", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Alfred"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Alfred", "answer_start": 1409}]}]}, "1faf2a0b7e9269cc6ca9c5cbaa480a3eff71b94b": {"passage": "Taxi driver Joe Lourik gets into an argument with a finance company over payments owed on his new cab.

Drake skipped lectures to travel by train to the sessions in Sound Techniques studio, London. Inspired by John Simon's production of Leonard Cohen's album Songs of Leonard Cohen, Boyd was keen that Drake's voice would be recorded in a similar close and intimate style, \"with no shiny pop reverb\". He sought to include a string arrangement similar to Simon's, \"without overwhelming ... or sounding cheesy\". To provide backing, Boyd enlisted various contacts from the London folk rock scene, including Fairport Convention guitarist Richard Thompson and Pentangle bassist Danny Thompson (no relation). To provide string arrangements, Boyd already had in mind Richard A. Hewson.\nInitial recordings did not go well: the sessions were irregular and rushed, taking place during studio downtime borrowed from Fairport Convention's production of their Unhalfbricking album. Tension arose as to the direction of the album: Boyd was an advocate of George Martin's approach of \"using the studio as an instrument\", while Drake preferred a more organic sound. Dann has observed that Drake appears \"tight and anxious\" on bootleg recordings from the sessions, and notes a number of Boyd's unsuccessful attempts at instrumentation. Both were unhappy with Hewson's contribution, which they felt was too mainstream for Drake's songs. Drake suggested his college friend Robert Kirby as a replacement. Though Boyd was sceptical about taking on an inexperienced amateur music student, he was impressed by Drake's uncharacteristic assertiveness, and agreed to a trial. Kirby had previously presented Drake with some arrangements for his songs. While Kirby provided most arrangements for the album, its centrepiece \"River Man\", which echoed the tone of Delius, was orchestrated by the veteran composer Harry Robertson.\nPost-production difficulties delayed the release by several months, and the album was poorly marketed and supported. In July, Melody Maker described Five Leaves Left as \"poetic\" and \"interesting\", though NME wrote in October that there was \"not nearly enough variety to make it entertaining\". It received little radio play outside shows by more progressive BBC DJs such as John Peel and Bob Harris. Drake was unhappy with the inlay sleeve, which printed songs in the wrong running order and reproduced verses omitted from the recorded versions. In an interview, his sister Gabrielle said: \"He was very secretive. I knew he was making an album but I didn't know what stage of completion it was at until he walked into my room and said, 'There you are.' He threw it onto the bed and walked out!\"", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Drake", "title": "Nick Drake", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What are the names of the people who were unhappy with someone's contribution?", "query_id": "80817fb42f2caaa9f6402de4006467fec8db4489", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Boyd", "Drake"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Boyd", "answer_start": 1006}, {"text": "Drake", "answer_start": 1101}]}, {"question": "What are the names of the people who felt someone's contribution was too mainstream?", "query_id": "4563faa168858b7f36743d39ef4775f60abbb261", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Drake", "Boyd"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Drake", "answer_start": 1101}, {"text": "Boyd", "answer_start": 272}]}, {"question": "Who was impressed by someone's uncharacteristic assertiveness?", "query_id": "3d1088bd3789e0d2bf14e794de9dea75f68d689e", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Boyd"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Boyd", "answer_start": 1481}]}, {"question": "Who agreed to a trial?", "query_id": "c362e30d12f86b950088caded210d3406c8c7481", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Boyd"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Boyd", "answer_start": 1481}]}, {"question": "Gabrielle is whose sister?", "query_id": "cf1d46178223604f7a60a333a3d30749d48c456c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Drake"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Drake", "answer_start": 2287}]}, {"question": "Who was said to be very secretive?", "query_id": "30f0c1428af4108846a0d70d207b53bcac112b74", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Drake"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Drake", "answer_start": 2287}]}, {"question": "What are the names of the people who were unhappy with Hewson's contribution?", "query_id": "94f1453200bfa7ab22110d80c84feaf88aa40c6c", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Boyd", "Drake"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Boyd", "answer_start": 1006}, {"text": "Drake", "answer_start": 1101}]}, {"question": "Whose sister said: \"He was very secretive\"?", "query_id": "f36304694f1f60e131479963096d60231279d353", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Drake"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Drake", "answer_start": 2287}]}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person who provided most arrangements for the album?", "query_id": "9f771ee1cf9689de06c4b97868bb8c3bff99e833", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Robert Kirby"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Robert Kirby", "answer_start": 1443}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the person who Gabrielle said walked into her room?", "query_id": "4c36b120013e8ce4320f9048e3002437c3795df3", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Drake"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Drake", "answer_start": 2287}]}]}, "e6bc617757f77700d40508eac4753c1048f47343": {"passage": "Etty considered Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret one of his major works.\nFollowing its exhibition at the 1833 Summer Exhibition, it was exhibited in August of the same year at the Royal Manchester Institution.

Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that \"It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not. We can do better than that.'\"In 1992, current guitarist Darren Middleton was invited to join Powderfinger by Fanning and Haug, after they were impressed by his work in Brisbane band Pirate. Middleton accepted the offer and became the fifth member, joining Jon Coghill who had replaced Bishop as drummer. The line-up of Fanning, Middleton, Haug, Collins, and Coghill then remained unchanged.Throughout the late 1990s, Powderfinger rose to prominence throughout Australia, receiving several accolades and achieving highly successful record and concert ticket sales. As the most vocal and prominent member of the band, the popularity for the group elevated Fanning as a powerful individual in the public view of the Australian music industry.

Lyrically, the song discusses Stefani's fears of beginning a solo career. \"Rich Girl\", a collaboration with rapper Eve, is a dancehall and reggae reworking of the English duo Louchie Lou & Michie One's 1994 song \"If I Was a Rich Girl\", which itself interpolates the song \"If I Were a Rich Man\" from the 1964 musical Fiddler on the Roof. The Neptunes-produced track \"Hollaback Girl\" combines 1980s hip hop with dance music. It was written as a response to a derogatory comment that grunge musician Courtney Love made, referring to Stefani as a cheerleader.The fourth track \"Cool\" chronicles Stefani's previous relationship with Tony Kanal, featuring a new wave and synth-pop production. The song was compared to Cyndi Lauper and Madonna songs from the 1980s. \"Bubble Pop Electric\", the fifth track, is an electro song featuring Andr\u00e9 3000's alias Johnny Vulture. It tells of the two having sex at a drive-in movie, and it was generally well received by critics, who drew comparisons to the 1978 film Grease and its 1982 sequel Grease 2. \"Luxurious\" is a 1990s-inspired R&B song that lyrically talks about the desire to be rich in love, simultaneously comparing Stefani's lover with luxuries. The seventh track, \"Harajuku Girls\", is a synth-pop song that was described as a tribute to Tokyo's street culture, produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.\"Crash\" is an electroclash song that uses automobile metaphors to describe a relationship. \"The Real Thing\" was described as a vintage Europop song, and features guest appearances from New Order vocalist Bernard Sumner and bassist Peter Hook. The next track, the synth-pop song \"Serious\", drew comparisons to Madonna's work during the early 1980s. A music video was produced for the song, but it was never officially released, although a snippet of the video surfaced on YouTube in October 2006. \"Danger Zone\", an electro-rock song, was widely interpreted to be about Stefani's husband Gavin Rossdale having an illegitimate daughter; however, the song had been written before the discovery. The closing track \"Long Way to Go\" is an outtake from Andr\u00e9 3000's album The Love Below (2003).

He listens to the recordings he made during their time together.\nThe film returns to the period shortly after the book's release. Although initially skeptical of the high praise Wallace's book is receiving, Lipsky \u2013 a writer having only marginal success \u2013 is awestruck after reading it. He persuades his editor at Rolling Stone magazine to give him an assignment to interview Wallace during his book tour.\nThe journalist travels to meet Wallace at his home on the outskirts of Bloomington-Normal, Illinois (near Illinois State University where the author teaches writing). Lipsky finds the young author unassuming and amiable, but indifferent to being interviewed. Wallace permits Lipsky to tape-record their conversations, with the proviso that Lipsky won't use any direct quotes which Wallace asks to have taken \"off the record\" five minutes later.

Evidence of neolithic and megalithic cultures have also been found in the state. Gold discovered in Harappa was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka, prompting scholars to hypothesise about contacts between ancient Karnataka and the Indus Valley Civilisation ca. 3300 BCE.Prior to the third century BCE, most of Karnataka formed part of the Nanda Empire before coming under the Mauryan empire of Emperor Ashoka. Four centuries of Satavahana rule followed, allowing them to control large areas of Karnataka. The decline of Satavahana power led to the rise of the earliest native kingdoms, the Kadambas and the Western Gangas, marking the region's emergence as an independent political entity. The Kadamba Dynasty, founded by Mayurasharma, had its capital at Banavasi; the Western Ganga Dynasty was formed with Talakad as its capital.\nThese were also the first kingdoms to use Kannada in administration, as evidenced by the Halmidi inscription and a fifth-century copper coin discovered at Banavasi. These dynasties were followed by imperial Kannada empires such as the Badami Chalukyas, the Rashtrakuta Empire of Manyakheta and the Western Chalukya Empire, which ruled over large parts of the Deccan and had their capitals in what is now Karnataka. The Western Chalukyas patronised a unique style of architecture and Kannada literature which became a precursor to the Hoysala art of the 12th century. Parts of modern-day Southern Karnataka (Gangavadi) were occupied by the Chola Empire at the turn of the 11th century. The Cholas and the Hoysalas fought over the region in the early 12th century before it eventually came under Hoysala rule.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "title": "Karnataka", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What are the full names of the two dynasties that were followed by imperial Kannada empires such as the Badami Chalukyas, the Rashtrakuta Empire of Manyakheta and the Western Chalukya Empire?", "query_id": "6c42630ac25dd3ad6261568ada992ab22440388a", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "date": ""}, "spans": ["Kadamba Dynasty", "Western Ganga Dynasty"]}, "original_answer": [{"text": "Kadamba Dynasty", "answer_start": 859}, {"text": "Western Ganga Dynasty", "answer_start": 934}]}]}, "701a732c6401a70a9e2be8e2f95adfbf6c4cae37": {"passage": "Four of the men deserted when they reached the Neches River. La Salle and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for two months. While the men recovered, the group ran low on food and gunpowder. In August, the eight surviving members of the expedition returned to Fort Saint Louis, having never left East Texas.While La Salle was gone, six of those who had remained on the Belle finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors did not know how to sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.By early January 1687, fewer than 45 of the original 180 people remained in the colony, which was beset by internal strife. La Salle believed that their only hope of survival lay in trekking overland to request assistance from New France, and some time that month he led a final expedition to try to reach the Illinois Country. Fewer than 20 people remained at Fort Saint Louis, primarily women, children, and those deemed unfit, as well as seven soldiers and three missionaries with whom La Salle was unhappy. Seventeen men were included on the expedition, including La Salle, his brother, and two of his nephews. While camping near present-day Navasota on March 18, several of the men quarreled over the division of buffalo meat. That night, an expedition member killed one of La Salle's nephews and two other men in their sleep. The following day La Salle was killed while approaching the camp to investigate his nephew's disappearance. Infighting led to the deaths of two other expedition members within a short time. Two of the surviving members, including Jean L'Archeveque, joined the Caddo. The remaining six men, led by Henri Joutel,  made their way to Illinois Country. During their journey through Illinois to Canada, the men did not tell anyone that La Salle was dead.

They declared that the Chinese laborers had no right to work in a particularly desirable \"room\" in the mine; miners were paid by the ton, thus location was important to the miners. A fight broke out, and two Chinese workers at pit number six were badly beaten. One of the Chinese workers later died due to his injuries. The white miners, most of whom were members of the Knights of Labor, walked out of the mine.After the work stoppage at pit number six, more white miners assembled near the town. They marched to Rock Springs by way of the railroad, carrying firearms. At about 10:00 a.m., the bell in the Knights of Labor meeting hall tolled, and the miners inside the building joined the already large group. There were white miners who opted to go to saloons instead of joining the gathering mob, but by 2:00 p.m., the saloons and grocers were persuaded by a Union Pacific official to close.With the saloons and grocers closed, about 150 men, armed with Winchester rifles, moved toward Chinatown in Rock Springs. They moved in two groups and entered Chinatown by crossing separate bridges. The larger group entered by way of the railroad bridge and was divided into squads, a few of which remained standing on the opposite side of the bridge outside Chinatown. The smaller group entered by way of the town's plank bridge.Squads from the larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a position at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour to pack up and leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell to the ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went.

[...] It was clear that, from the time whatever hit him to the moment he had landed on the floor, Elvis hadn't moved.\" Attempts to revive him failed, and his death was officially pronounced at 3:30 p.m. at the Baptist Memorial Hospital.President Jimmy Carter issued a statement that credited Presley with having \"permanently changed the face of American popular culture\". Thousands of people gathered outside Graceland to view the open casket. One of Presley's cousins, Billy Mann, accepted $18,000 to secretly photograph the corpse; the picture appeared on the cover of the National Enquirer's biggest-selling issue ever.
